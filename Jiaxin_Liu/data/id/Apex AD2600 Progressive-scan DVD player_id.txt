5e085a1e00ed1f1fb630a4cf78796a6d im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
d92bb66f6058ae31c994677a1918fedc but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
af9293b774ea03119641279a9b05de29 it practically plays almost everything you give it .
cd5b349634b4fc9c4d56bec8bf4015ef i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
299154a61f199e278648ef719bf92a4a for the price it is a well spent investment !
31280fcc80b002b253c67d27b10ef930 this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
d4aea072a4d82c259b1c6322dc4b650a it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
de26e922f5cfd35c976f25852b35be7d its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
5051b108de7ddff5f7158f5191b600b3 it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
43bd3fca24e560e70ef752b201fe7025 and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
52734e430145b0c2c8fc5bb9045f7f8b what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
abcfc87ba377f6fb97927982acca684b it sure does !
1945ab0b1f267012762a5680a4350280 that 's a rare and valuable feature .
ed685788d49ef224fd9aff02e8d7de41 another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
fc4d099a1153a71bea4c56380ad60ca8 at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
21b5b1779d52da82b0a477fbf05b65d0 weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
fe19754870ba8de34ab8b68d4788bf6a update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it !
a40a39fa44c86ca04381bee009530f2f many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
cf41831e2da909f9f2f586b141c7735a player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
c6a83ea9da57eb20f326e6abc581d1df player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
e7f3ce5f284bb9a7ef6e174c80f700e8 i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
a8d92b901f74924149bfabe02f8c52e9 will never purchase apex again .
fe25796c3aa51c7efb1577d4bbf69e05 customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
d460f81b43998cfb748cde2be9836aec for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
f9838d9b72a7789c510f9f1470a3f3a5 then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
ded43ef4232c5c23698e001714547447 new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
ea5b53db7c04661245957ff76c2f1b09 i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
a7b8634eb63de9c056ba583150f2ca48 this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
e5eb01e1b13846967ad1deaaabcb862f apex does n't answer the phone .
41af8b2de77c1ad0f7a99c2ac2a10d9c no way to contact their customer service .
70af5f4ccbd91c344f06921f8f150e57 very bad quality .
fe7e064c5f0fe9bf989fab990cc0ea99 i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
013cee43ecda4846af87ce9c321e6494 i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
85ec2b6883a8b77183c2fab775941c66 have used it frequently and have had no problems .
debfef92b991c030a07183a002e02d85 i liked this one enough to buy another .
3f04a58bcda5a12c04c16b5a555e8d34 my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
f79b17a89c5ad1b3a2e790a644f71628 great quality picture and features .
019577ce8c04845b2b74bd46e14180b8 they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
3998b3cfdd9be2cd1979133d78106636 nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
b017cec6fb1dab7c46b18cbaffa2a15f this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
c061b6355830cf6ac81be0cb8b239614 the door would not close .
2589eec9c0810963d3f6dd105caaef58 i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
5dbe0792295c9820d86841e5c5bb0571 it looks great - and is loaded with features .
0942f435929400399b67445a10a44923 unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type .
40a123bfea587831e306ec839a90c2db have had problems since the first day
04401531e9b307a2b46ddd79d8c9ad41 - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
75a1c2102d97efb4fbb45ac6e92cc92c the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
7ef427a642196960a482f80d71605a02 i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
bc4fd788088b7d13a7ad14a8de531330 it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .
03e1cd38959d29902a3f05c616118533 it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time .
5a3288ba1d03d602b3367a0c74ac0315 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . "
4dd930bcd01ca419dfbadc9a276e001f ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
9947e0d4813586c77a652fb805fbac2e the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
f01bd384c7ae77d1a2329c0a9d0cd49f the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
89af97a6226c5a62de6b547c45eae741 i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
333b4a5f75a098a9893380f984f852e6 i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
30650f7a1d07890704d95cb9a272243b the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
7af5f9063dfe89e3985faf01fe1b23f6 having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
76c0ecbf16267145a0a13adfd8ecc01d while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
94eb2a5d54aa0fd7950ffa60bb938a2d it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
3020d821b551c6b32600053da89f4f37 i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
5a4e986037497f778e251b4e6639e61a i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
67c8385076080a18316abfe5ca566509 wo n't play a lot of discs .
3e4f65f7d84c096fc8a86b3cbf9e09d8 some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
6243125815c5da78dd6e1c10e397dd46 it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
2910c5f1c17bb398499de714e1190cad tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
f9c0d6993d83834a975c2f716b37a7cb i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
01719225364bc50a2c53e18110e71e23 it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
5133cd81120b019b0d19569344b9254d the dvd player does not work properly .
9151bec746be1369933e0711724fabba the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
be4b7903a9d098dd895e2eb70527204a this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
15ca73c960a5b529f735a4e3ccbe10c1 after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
442feced4c0259e0cca5963edd62fcf1 nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
257f0113e671267abaa6f56bd4f6a63a unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
a3501130193708007cd28c5fd53b8965 on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
65fa020842bdf7e8d1b730089acf7969 unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
9606498e6333ccdfc118a265ea813338 we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
6eef518602a7cd948f9f4698d3515a9f even viewed cds full of jpgs .
5ebdc26241f99d1ac3b88f4e627fbe24 but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
bf1e79759598297ca36cecaaac4165f8 i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
98cf7a577e0471bf9d08c0c71a8cb9d3 who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
1a0284a937d6f776c0dd445ba87180e1 we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked .
6e5204af1151707aebba1f5f0526b68d ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
8a6a1411b8cc32b24107eb3a847bf53d i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
52d064e0397bd437e90f70454572fa0e the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
f96777b605bac7df6334c8ee0c8f6373 i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
b545dae2cfa2e4679fe9626d77bb6bc1 door broke after a month .
e2d322370ca64b148ed382cc9bdc8413 unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
b148288c80526fb256ec4194b4107d73 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
0faa454c4967e025967b67ee1142b523 well , it was nice while it lasted .
b7454b0a15647a8206f34e79352f4291 after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
b72a72e26271e6ddf7601d5ccd169c94 as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
79116e665d3679b4d7e6fb60fd58f2f8 only used for 3 month before it 's down !
0d0f8d64973f708c799e4e49d6909dfd it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
52dcfd70b988f7387128d0690c5725e0 the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
9e38049ed9f49341fa5a1da94a3facee the entire unit was poorly crafted .
9f5b56cc80841af968d3f05f2e233227 there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
e603c6f4fbf730e9d4e0fb6cdebbc90a after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
ee716d9e4b7b96be567b5ce318f78112 the dvd player just would't recognize them .
315c1f1d70df18c343035b159b8fa102 it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
304f55c4c30167a6dd8bf365c2f321c6 this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
882f8c2afb0b7af577d6c9ab03ee0778 i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
31e58601d37c2cb59bba17738e967015 they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
d1f50b170c43b383723518bc9faf225b because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
d1f5cf6191b3c90d8622b5f87670e411 the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
560274a9bead90f84eabdc4ed032b70c it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
71b6cd812bbbbaa721bb8c2de2cd2520 i find this to be a great feature .
2239f41ad560f533fdd5cca77192e5ff i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
b5938c00042cd746390dea8b55ef54ef for the money apex machines have good features .
0a3d6bf18633218545bbb81dd93b8f68 it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
27f3bc59911b5af3a7407bad6d3865bd i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
0bfa82289f942fddd400eab00bc1b7e0 now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
14e79384734cdf96d7dae0e8a659a946 less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . "
ab047c6e984d9cc4e7eef8f6bf293360 same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
7f8064a47247d5d7c3d9f96b0cb56d24 i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
368c413655d2e3b779a34ef7a27efb85 the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
e938caf51ea8e0d24b0f060a2fa90eac loved the slim design .
128ca9a28ef4109d9418125dc61b8cd3 this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
0caf267f58e20737045ff66e235d0697 apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
bd4faa5e55cc04220850959d137341d5 audio is excellent .
d831e6dfd1d181e2878a4cd115f63f66 i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
b9a98fdcce866a86cc04e64979d6053b but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
a1388fbea802db236da3b80551d5292c simple to use and hook up .
1b4b8b00a1be6322acc0a3232c0e902d the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
28d4d1b1a741ac5070c52078b57dd05b this dvd play is basicly junk .
fc19a133494f5792d161ce43f122f8ae it wo n't play all of my movies .
05ad13e3319c08b5b812357b73571b94 i tried called apex cust service , no help .
f741149d2b9ee83dd1df5aa010e1df7d mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
03e240f342f2e26e015671987b28528a each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
192d1feac80f1b657136f3ef38389d3c this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
d8f94f4f264715affd22929f3e2de0be this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
62cf1a8d3b2e903f5a6f46e8d99bb3c2 i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
2a1edb6a0f322e1800ffc50b6c0183ca well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
f1ea952ffd3cb666c023f31c40f6900f it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
783860069c179f2f92dfde358673afd8 i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
4fb852ec14462e823ccc18ab597d17b6 i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
80cb6fbb20332fa22c5eba0f351a1901 and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
531ac3aa28e0b5a35ebf739df52d7021 one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
29d2614f705ec8f146e4eddeb3c87bcf finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
684ffae9430925f14cec7dcbe28b19c8 i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
5a50460035755ae78b5099854653ac30 the first one would n't work from the start .
5a15b8f4196aaff0214cee46db5bdc1b the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
62e789092dd8cdbdc780fb92af24cb33 i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
1bb0466c467ad147fa770ae552afdb45 for the most part this is a good dvd player .
80a2e096524056f7ac5d85b13f7b69fe but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
53d899d38b3399eed2fd4fcd17573512 we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
9cfdc3efb45542494649a4edd3af3cf8 there was neither picture nor sound .
de5dc342d4054b1a200ec1a82e9b6b01 we are overall pleased with product .
505dde255328ad9519d6f8181477c858 i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
e4730539ff132950b9f794e6c42e8042 it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
4e76cc39ae9044560ecd410fbbf8ce76 i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
0eb9d14fcd2b19b6fc93f4d30b718c0f neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
26b5a2527b86f2059791586f76c6fc5d it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
559deec06532af818dc647a493e9e9dc progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
c6d4707ef2fab9972637895ce8590367 seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
447f20fd6837855357f840dde335f353 also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
89ec4ff01b352ade745a12c65404dee0 output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
6513c98716058aac2f83fc6564af3fd0 i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
842947cb2552799a774e509cdcb6aeac it would just spin up and stop , and display " no disc " .
972c9a8ae7cdb01c2d55a7fe93e6ecd2 my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
997d3afc8d64edc1a148be2f556c789c you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
7c16ca68a8ef98cfd220f1e6c613cf21 also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 " tv ).
98987f7c3d051f108c91a160e1342d6f i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
c1e8ee517180185f5ad066d4fef1ecc4 i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
5f111fdce14b94dc1ed718d0e82f14d1 looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
1f6a9f221bde39b56aa9de7f07074b19 and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !
471167f0d53ba2354a39ea1ce52ff533 this thing plays everything i feed it .
8fd7717f6f4b86db0002350fe4354721 when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
1884b63b7e64eae77c5a882b7904a99b easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
3eeccdd614b5715452570757f516d0df after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
916ded6e726fc19e2219983902f8cd1d i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
bf11e0d9d60fdbec8953849166b29dbf i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
84b1024ad0a1d46bdae5884e7a70760c i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
da129bba41c6b4caec15e2ffb3afe7a5 it has never worked .
f7c6a30b651882d1ae5523552ba03649 i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
2a2083d8c309dbd4ca3c58a375818a8e purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
842e381eac600c9db0359c412d19b63d the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
43d2280c977528ef30e6669b0e5ece09 they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
f19f2fe2f09551bcbbcd30b19d27ceb5 i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
c43abed7f15effb4bbf9b56cd5cdb4e1 3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
a2ba39633cfd1bca8635eeaadeea97ee now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
34adbcd8b054b1e63dd33e3621b1aabd have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
5e1d5e113391620216763a93847e83bd have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
868792ac3108030b1fe791004f12c147 this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
0d7130509568edc5932b436be650acad after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
a66b194c44c2a5f041dfcb010cfe3532 i can only hear the sound but no picture !
a94200729f072904e7f981c116aa5bed their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .
2b256f2eeebd9c2eb272bbcf21c261be one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
aec28a98162256e3164389abc0d1370c some dvd 's i rented would not play .
3cb598830d17cf87874a5a2af03a542e when the player was working it was great ,but .
f7f3873b04f2e4a497667646eb3b0796 it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
992ba8e6d2465b13f037d361d528c22a without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
4eb2916f8d98495adbe213ce373daf44 excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
b1d2c287ea4bba686b01d6ad02db38a0 remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
650f5a9fc8d23e1f5feb8370e59dc04f first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .
9b11689d3b0c95dc2f00e7b8943b4934 unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
01bd9627b997fb43d6e384241050849a as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
726152eaeaf36e106f50419011dfab6a what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
9bda6f3b3d54d3179789e2d0c3aa99fa for example , i tried playing my new " pirates of the carribean " extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
37f15e561ae7ac9028bbedac55bbb567 at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my " alias " dvds as well .
328564a122898c77ba7fd6bd1d5f8da8 this player seems to work fine with everything else .
d27b1ba7dd0f29e68cd04cf6cf47ef85 because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
9b045c61c91296cac109f652232a84d0 it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
862e0d8256d5175b4c962e3c6454f2af i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
c65e97e04502114bb0b48321d4f212b8 most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
e1f52a97f5e6bf03b8a709efc5c77ee7 this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
1c6d2ae44a6618884b7d5815cc740ab4 i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
304678fb79adc7d18bc570816e65c16f so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
8622028862bbdbc5519e576b28ae2630 after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
955aeb18a12fd08bf87d4a2dfad715de apex sucks !
f0de164b2c326340eb68111c456ff18a unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
32ea776ee4efc0b2bbcd509ec2656593 it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
1a75f65daeb3cf2d68dd0dd806a825e8 basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
c6b55dc63ae357379b1ceebd32e4b39a so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
5b3429e381941b13bbcb18bc671c6eaf the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
4eadb02423a841209104f9bbc14fba06 the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie " extras " on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
44cf734d431dbf051f39dd01666d0eb4 it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
cbee6021bf2e6de4d5fc0d30431a6bb0 i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
743d393e14577bf959e749d021569400 there are a lot of things i like about it .
9f50c25f5f7fb84cc8995a85ac62697d received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
85cbc07247c9d953a80e3b0cf102bf7c the remote is a little hard to understand .
3210f2c3f2483e081a38fc420d67d960 my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 " screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 " monitor .
b111b6d69704c3ae5a4e92f58a249c73 so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .
663ffff0818ee826a31e2e44d1e947bd video output stopped workin .
fd5d79635e62e72731e1862fddea2526 this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
2b03bde79cf4d23f921e63061e140d37 what a disappointment !
8b1c6a2445c0347cb80255ceb9ad1693 set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
d15aeb3a555dbb00f357302c32daabc9 there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
cc85799283131d1b9c5ace392e9fc7b7 but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
99eba61575e6b77e2206475329ee2445 amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
861504db448efd462039eef3646bd387 great feature list , poor reliability .
2cb1086b096dffabf3ec5cb402e64143 output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
4fe69cda9a1a4c5f33bf92f20dbaf4e0 retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
d207950b5632304baf3d4d84342cf373 it works great .
554c4ad0dd6259a9c61e4817388e8064 the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " !
b471b2d427e623361da6a9861a24aef8 p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
bde131aa7fa90047b83775c3a2c46d0d what the hell is wrong with this thing .
3f3779a73e73c8430f134c2c7dca084f forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
7f9e4ac7f4f6719b8cb4b942368f0195 well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
030e50a9427a380f40f338e4d797faba so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
fb6630c3e9f347aaaa6af14240c7ff21 the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
8003f18325b4698dbe170e04a52ddd2b it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
76d840b24bd2063c716af94af9053f6b update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
b3d6250f8c0e2d723e032191144e6c20 the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
44fa354def3a024a49de7a6b055cf68c i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
3b4fc57da00c1271e4bcb0f82e62fd94 after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
d92c1f7e4159142d5178f8469f8bd359 only one disk played through to completion successfully .
1792df2bfdafa1b8f08a99ebc90380d9 when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
034391c92fae4d4613f259670a4dc0e4 when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
9e974418af550929cc2c1482881d2621 imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
226c5ab99e4834810f6aebe3d2e99951 the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
0bf16d5f06b47eca2b4b60bd737ddf9a the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
5f84086d8d330d61cb3f0c40f5302bc1 amazon is awaesome !
dd779d35ed2e7e983717bdcef1517780 for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
7b185dc9dc52f36cb42d1ebf9b7745f6 the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
e3ebe7333e6dfe0db5ab794351ccef66 it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
a7842f2e2a9d2255b9e6cb39ee2886fb and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
a981acb506188c8737a2ad731e15dfff i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
0c3dd192dff0c47d17d2b4ed61d35509 the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
dbf3a991da5b884a9959f9342d9a9f32 i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
f54e2636edbba92a909eace08e639719 we tried the " finding nemo " dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
abccd17f9d816346b079fc7aa544ac77 i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
ef8c9c3238c0997f0a50179e0167afa6 only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
c9abcac1df5d3968c0b2671f58bf3396 the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
4f137c279c013095e582a54eab397844 besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
4d9962edc89880c4d1b4b8a419edfd4a it plays everything , even vcd 's .
ee22081e8cd12d74048fda24c3d08289 i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
dcd208035ed995f91f09faf465f702b7 but for what i do use it is perfect .
3f2d50a7ab8d5ca60ebd9f86781931f9 1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "
bbe63f0328f52170d91cf129c76fd211 2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .
a475cd1c0454d10a130c0e05e28e193d 5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
00551d1526f91ae7108880eca085b00c finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
cc11c712dec9b78a5e6186104998785b one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
69ded3dab3f77a5cae0dc1ee1928aae0 owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
4db039d429e9bf8b4c5b79ac98b949da apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .
74f5e24e9641d9668bffdc61cfcfa718 the dvd player is fine .
94f5e5ad9e4b2b29c82f4270c4abf035 of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
6e605a7e27c3d4ecb6182473f750fb9f the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
6e14905dd215b804dd1d67fcb9341dd5 it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
31aa5c3f5d31378b6c3d2a52028a86f5 but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
542d552b6a80169971106c0493d88457 when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
eaf28814dbb3074b0659f527029d3186 seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , " no disc " .
256a16fc9dc0e71824538ba5f5652a2a granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .
499db2ac0845c79245f70ba7c8bc100b first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
5c1bddbc377f83e19689b74d88c1a627 this is extemely lame .
48452b00f56fb6ca13348ad1d92debd5 the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
8ba70e597cfc6e241555d687623ddb4e in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
ac784394d0d8b253878624ada2154654 the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
18a811188b23fa256c321e42f38cf95e after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
521121be8f6569821c970c8fc219b7d7 it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
9c5252c44d1ab48d1e562937f43ffc12 both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
8dca0b9f08fdb7c46061d68705889afb one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
625d471844b0c4831e1c2656db644042 the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
84b3210547b32bd5ab20ec53b3438380 there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
9982cf025cf09cf43f1be57afa09155b all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
2025b4edf2d69fbd4b39760b1f763881 i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
d8105077a4434e718fee25bbe1966b63 i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
29b3d3e5ed678f6cc992b525c42e3c1a i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
51852e0480cd7ec9f0c69cb3d7012a3b there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
e84bda7445af61e44a722324fcdbccf7 still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
07832c69663afb284da4ae0d63bcc64b i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
b11981e4a01b7e3b11d36cc9c503897b i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
b67ad94887eab38c5108dac9319a1913 i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
3ea5962d4e53b81077f68cb9fa6cd4b0 unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
e1fa274c45a3d786c5a8eef4ad84ec31 i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
01718f91df378fcdfc1e18e529d84f5e this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
83e9f5a06e9e14fe2fc55a1563f15ee0 ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
b1ebe13ded22c85b218f059ffd618f4a good looks
168375c1396ae73de3fde98510ddc928 the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
d79245d81b4060e7f727fdd27f624fad remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
bf481030e644dc8ef932d183242a13dd this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
fcc77a7acb16badcd209eeeef55a9e9c i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
291b89defbbe4a497ff51c7d8d63f47c apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
cf747929cdd68c4ba428097b0cf1e56a also , very light and portable .
a594ce84433d4c898f581803a652ab4c the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
c82e6d350f624f918e300fffbbcad423 it will read and play all cd audio disc .
eaa7bd673796d9bd7a28be3b08a90c63 i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
2bde27ec076a78d9ec7c4cd85403b097 however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
a6a630f2c2b2c25834e78ab16528f156 it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
0cb5a3225519a6eec33759dd59fd6ac7 on several different occasions it has displayed " no disc " with a disc inside .
5af90fdafd59b525226aefa2ffc9fd00 i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
63177394a9aad661b5b0c97bd5c4b8f6 the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
805fb64ce9cfd89eb965b553110a9c78 it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
91e28925c3f898f27b3023291ecee22e however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
a8ace68534381de6693b2cd4a413efea also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
b2d71aa5c89ea5c46f9690a4448bb3e9 good quality video .
d971ba472d37cee787a974beea87a655 can 't say whether i rec 'd an " updated " model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
b04a1b6bbf5356e9d6ebf7e31273b479 it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
2359d422951fd48bbe8711993ef70ada mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
cd704648bf583767f520f7800329f7ce this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
63310a5e17e811681d048ee50bff3ac2 the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
2bee94baba588db03a65283b3379e242 it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
61b0cbdba9d3d1062735828f148c2ac5 i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
e831e965366d5a0aac3ac4e17d514a91 i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
eb49671e2b0f5b54b7dfefe2d8de0a1b there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
2a3121c4cb05cc9f848d6bedc84751d5 so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
a5a333667ea01279e3392a1206408e0b noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
0bd186f76e74c82503b313c048781adb works great !
6d685a8248c25916f3c4493aec1d226c silverish color really adds a special touch .
f8e8b06b80ac0d9f1a09a6206e2b31a3 it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
7c56e1066942129bcbd2cfaf542d75a8 either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
b3d05727b48f2b165c0f312b7235290d i am really impressed by this dvd player .
cb2481936526033884407b90cc7ee91a for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
ab1c9dcd2760939fe9998b9e2d3355b0 no matter the format .
