0640603a2170d71444627f4f433fd0bd there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
30ac5799a8c27d2c007dd4c2f01016a7 after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
4e3e16c7d6dc2759d671c13215fece25 i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
1e497d003ead8f158733c4abb51c307b my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
fc2a9006a1200588dbe570f338d7accb the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
ef6ad218bc4eef8f153f8382e40b1d89 the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
d91e2e3ad9ceb824579f6c9037ef53c0 the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
d7872021c24cdae721ebe5bfb25a4bea after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
b2f4d720af4b3e13021ec32d815a83e9 here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
60918d91db20f0758f77fc85122e79da it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
272a58a1b62523e335da2584a82415e0 i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
e8e469c6ce127a2b8e862966b0c3685e the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
cb73b87bc53d6be47ba62c64c5eefff1 the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
176c335143b62d493291b9381376198f the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
0e06083fe29cb04b2490c7bed0b91061 the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
0fd1a39fbd9bf7572e59b5af4057aeba the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
c32ba4ad3fa103f4135a20f248f76d36 the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
7b0c7e612d4594b5feb8cc2e0327afd4 the volume .
b1faecc5dd56946295f5940b7205af66 i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
fc90868e1e0f6cb223d2b895b690050b on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
d59318453bccd6b57857e2fa7b73f426 i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
9718155632e05d67d9ee2d34d80ae0bf i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
0f6c7d35d2490b7ca16cdcb8408f2fd6 also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
9033599cf1f3031d4cb1f20eb5cfedbe since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .
b5327e3ee32cce3ce1ba792f2b91d0a3 i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
eb5960db45bea27cec164d0be627fcf5 apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
4647078efdaaedb5b3a4aceb7bf82fe3 in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
1f9933726e41699013c87cc15f21a066 t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
0bd4b7ea23395053267cfdb384e926bd however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
464ae5e381f94d45fed8ae02ad5e7495 i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
4a033dd098f948a950a96c60e7eef3a4 while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
ed192d62003130c4d569a0a4a5335f00 i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
5951baa50c5670e7c4fcac86438fba32 no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
e52d5fd102dc709b3e64330ff8edc1b0 from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
df13323ca2d2bad277b722c7c99e24f0 whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
a65e5a99fb034d3ac3e57d4f41070f43 i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
3c8ffb554f238698530ef85279f9b51f the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
8b15359b7863064bb6750c1a814f9531 some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
147682229af074d2520a07e45499562b the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
542ecb92087418bd79ca9e3c8a527ca6 the vibration is not top .
0a672f3d94178693fef4a061788aba10 overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
d0d621d83a44b4ab35ea2f818978ec04 great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
05eb101d87db513311b441188c2722e0 i am bored with the silver look .
d43fd9028c14d0fc8fcaa77456271140 it has a nice color screen .
0541452e5ad20b914789fea2b1c64fed it is small .
281040b8774d702e6c0e6bc76b39cd49 radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
bad709d57055304005f6f24f865dccd3 t-mobile was a pretty good server .
20bba5e23cf6400d03305ce74611bfbb they are not wowable good .
899c9fc0a381b12ecf6868e6490e9a08 it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
907a71d6c58acc8a9c22afee0469cda1 this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
624560fdbd238195725255ae991483d2 we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
18ee059bf53dd5ae2d4886fe25c789e5 when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
867e0d28796d18caa886b83e1e446570 while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
23f161907c6d5ce5f76a95f06dcb4341 negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
aa4cf9874eb6024ec9e908b53f471f6e poor visibility on the keys .
64fb66cc374fec3973bcd3984f004f56 the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
0f3ebda9dd649fa1b9ee293df38ce088 only con i can think of is no camera ... .
b18d97c31148dff6d6db14b6cfccefff this phone is a winner ...
f9c4741602222f5858fdfd5117f96f7f anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
77b556e279c1f849536cf447d15792cc the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
744203c0ba661b81fbf49e058d3b8553 this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
2c2e71ca4849170b6edf05a7af062446 as said before this works perfectly .
2180e3aa72c77087063e51f98d1dafb1 you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
4bded68e56dcf5480f4bc239f32c4df4 the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
ecd6a9d2d83fd2adb058ba02d80255f7 you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
89d1608e6db7e19a13aaf864a061353a only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
8920ebaa803b842f68dc03f411e539ae this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
c9d0d998766ff632aa6c28c85f4926f0 this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
fdd4d278af1bf0a366d02bf985906571 one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
9bd2f43850ccfea3e4b6a5ef927c98c6 i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
d379b42593ec45fb92354860d5f031da the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
a892ae4eda5b2b52e80f56aebc1e502c anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
75724e991eee9149c45dd759aeb7f1fd another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
44319df7de849e736c4e09bf62fef41e this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
86fbc0120dc9e7b25d672355dc9d3046 when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
21250d9726c5df5ab8b704a872ef5d69 this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
49ea47ece1672e42e5bb93b8e862afb3 the battery life on this phone is surreal .
c2a7637809be14daf7c7003015c6dcbc i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
068bd7c0f0afc39243b4899bb1fe99a4 it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
8b06ee9536157bdc30f89af9097efd4e this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
c67d6bcd1ecc6effe34a9f8354eddaa0 the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
17f6d670f0087e4bd79ea3d9763fd40b overall , i highly recommend this phone .
947e4a7f76574c8d9e61e6f0a4bf403d it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
fe5fec6558b2e30fcb5d27fdc47570d2 size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
d36bdc5dfa57c2ffcd3b26042b66d2e6 sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
c63b814a0a679b601fcf858056f31723 speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
5741b29bc5d1f08561ddf80eaccd827d surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
da1c9f96e2fdf6c174bc6a45a9e6ecb6 ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
712b40736863d9fcec15b1a1a63e4df4 the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
c16c5d2303fcab3823fe913b6b4cef82 games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
105924e46523168dd9a09a96a05d6a46 nice little phone ... light compact . .
ceb0982ee639d31ed4e5f43a46e69336 buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
c803c17bfceefa2bdbade542c896cde8 although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
c08ffc6c0204ff4421d6802f9f85c134 the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
8b4057f457380127479d55edc7268abf i like the size and weight of this little critter .
bc5f1642b16101e4228c81997a833126 i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
8c8bbd4a1f9a38c0933fcbd3803b117e the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
88b9aa2d53178b2ce98e7c56d5c5e0d8 the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
eeeacba322957f4c880a66e6ed2a23f0 the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
b7fe89c7512fb83bb17ebeaa6b53d631 it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
25b1cc0cda02ef1722164f8b75bb7712 there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
32158167217ff54b94e95aa2ab6ef249 the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
39cd6d6d2beb1c861a7741ec85243df9 the vibrate setting is loud !
31a10952a24e3cd6d534ff6a26abc33f so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
ca660c79507a52586bd84954fbe54df2 but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
cab382f4cf8673664054f60487223438 other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
ee4f9ea014db0467f570da311f7dd2ef - light , compact design
279afba7eb3af9e233fc1951d252d6e6 - solid , high-quality construction
25dd9f9401731661e5fb9235d8d76fce - well-backlit keypad
488636e06974d698e1fdaf82e4a7855d - outstanding signal reception
e5530a413b6c717bbc2f6d1ede7c1ead - excellent sound quality
d2fa4332430086507ce16ebe69abca1e - bright , visible screen
47c3fd2d6c83e36d6f84d9bcd30ba5d4 - speakerphone
abd839d5b620718f500d48ee8f35f4a0 - very long-lasting battery life
0813d454f44e30763260519b64aa2111 - some features in the user interface
bb1ec025423765d62734fdc80d2c52d6 - no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
79fdc99cd2e5ba077ab8625e5ec1d969 - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
c021234de7a3ab812c47e39f52c9b08a - no propietary headset jack
f3bb75d4d6b62c19c453c3d7a0d1fcd5 one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
aa3d46a7617bdd3968d20fd25bbbb69e i like the speakphone function a lot .
d3c431d83c1c511f4a70ed0aa6198494 i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
3f9cc3c78af4f8f3dbd173ab2962564f i like the automatic key lock function .
82e64d953b29aae10303bde70a8ad379 the phone is very light weight .
2fcb297b562e0085ac2b38a1e5132982 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
47adfb9e43ca12f5d6986c4d35f74169 the fm radio is cool .
e1f513486ead63210b2558f6ce800427 while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
d6508cf7de570cf330c9dbd17b8d3f48 and really this is the best phone one could have .
335bcc6ce494a124577345aecffc9989 it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
59a2ec1ac86933ead0b9c58aa109d6bc it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
8a2a59c57f95dc9e5061930baa5d1265 this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
326cf16219eae8f13c9dd3f7095d8206 it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
4e5aa4d9868bfcce9df64306ddf57b0c its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
285382587275bb6699276d5b9ea9c3ab it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
25663e0511f1372b1b8380dbf18b7a2c only if we could get one camera in it . .
d716a674425cad5f35cef12e2494768e i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
89e17bc3dd3643eef452c0b526b1397b small size .
078eacef9514bdf13938398ebbff9a50 i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
83edcf9dbb7d04798873f0f20de79e03 color screen is good .
baf721ae66c83d04627aed9efcbf7aab it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
6e389542d89508957c8af12f28f181a9 the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
1dc3740e06e3a4b6aef93300ba191638 navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
51fbabe1593a5f4cbee6d08b613bfdc3 battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
b04114762c3824238acb69a9f7c5cc55 the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
a463c417d6bbdccce9f687d36d1e016c pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
744f525296a4d9c08aa0fe2e19b27dba nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
f118bd4e6e431fb2d34e5648c625bd6d the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
2701b1794a0ea76ecda5d225153a920e i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
df4b2757c7fb3ddb025743cbe93973c1 the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
bc2579b51229368645d63774f91960e1 it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
643ae680e1c446a56269220fc32e4129 regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
47e3873452377bfeaeb451bfad9ba553 overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
793b5dd3a570afa3f48e4ec4ed2e097c this is the best phone i have seen .
804b696067270d8a0d3985843a4c90a4 the phones are awesome .
8709abbebe927492ab2305fce12bac51 we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
6a24487459d99b1b25825952b9db4493 you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
6f9adbe48884c146062517217a8d680d the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
3cfd003cfecd282858702db176f2d30e i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
431de366bef375532c8858467cdb6096 nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
cd886273a55bc57a2201d12617b65f4b i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
307c93e8a0e6940c41d5d78c4dba4954 the features are really cool like the radio .
b89efe0de0fd797ce86e413b78bcc046 the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
f7ad72dd81513ff8fba2a51a2ac0bd2f technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
fcf866589e0cd5066cdb86f7e386fe2e i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
5e621b8f3d3b01939c7ca7308eec4cd4 for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
58e7e474b8ea3dcf3293853aae627fc1 this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
e680c8f77215069e5769f8ec644a5cee this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
9e7c273eca137335035382a9dd0c7fe3 its quiet .
6fe554bb692034563c238b99119b81ec nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
a48b9a5c631fe1787665d9f8b3ec5e4d first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
5e751daaae716e505fbcaa7601c3930f i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
8ee54a07a100d3ae716ff48a9b13ef2a the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
6f246e08b12b7c7d2c4b842f18c3c222 the battery life is amazing .
66c96d417bca7af0fbf9a1d25d7bf577 the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
e15b74942a53b496fef02984e5eede92 i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
7805576b42f4a2a4f35d031b195b9927 i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
00f4f2006de708c2e8e1b5f70f053974 i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
bbdd399a8aa07bc878d531a293918676 it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
0774bbf5a1f65c236eec818161d3b56d this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
cd4327cb2d23f487b5853995261ec659 the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
79f516eeddde36a568767055712e8458 i simply love this feature .
9d0740971a20ab06bf942f4cdc6c18bf in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
e1bef08bc65ba3487923aec367168f32 the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
2788e7b6f62d9a35ddbc41822916180e the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
7d7d4d07552660b8043027100c94a48d additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
7c8f3f41daa8a96742203572b5b47386 the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
56432fb57d72bb6e3c00b29f7a0cac93 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
79912796c4d723c8ef835ad78c993024 i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
13e3ad521538757c809d312f2b720148 not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
238d0351c8c8c466d81f67763e3871b1 in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
7f5b26b2865cc958e9fec839306cd9cf the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
014aa078aecf0b50593f6613db26ebbc even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
7061a15f87a6a0019ec1573b56a2fbba although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
7aba4051c00fd6801f9538e897377aed the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
89657f0ad9be220dd030d9ed377f9984 however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
16e576df853ecd5249a85b8fa96cab45 in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
13122ae80c23db1e2c9f98a62a7202ef one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
28fd6ff95028de4d9ea392d1a09a45ff overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
437dfef5f0ddbb56dce9ac419c90f73d nokia does not disappoint in this model .
bb033600536809f287cbf986f6529298 one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
bc412b771cb33944aaf00912480e5a71 it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
abd74cd1dba7bfb5fe0802beda2c54f5 great phone .. .
e34cfc5c5d47ea85592063b8cfa07c03 great features .. .
2ba94a2d6897c0dc29eaf3f1c90562af i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
5560c8233e34185b814bf994e5893c76 i have had no problems with the phone .
8d147490bc04d64017ad35bd9084f37f great phone , i 'd buy another .
b8c4180a9c3121e6ea19a6b4eeabba04 excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
eccef5c5474671e4d4ab562e624bc4a1 one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
962d0a03e1daebad970b1586234fc351 overall an excellent phone .
d1de0c348ee15ec5bcf5d444ff8a78d8 the service from t-mobile is very good too .
bda6c10fbfa269bc9c256d0a04ea7069 great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
c0c6d11001c00e04512caa20fe3cae80 i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
51b1770d89037fd1f2b3010444b9217d nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
9b759b22613ccb3d5a5909c5cd771409 service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
311ef14e9030cb4c54bc34ae0487a489 this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
d3039095351362825c0bb445adb849f3 1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
f5f02fd53530db47224dc07fa8d49e9b yes , the features are numerous .
806cb5e252d42d9b0c9beb400622a8e9 the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
37a84a72000588d4bc0ae8bef4295a66 the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
70ebd096a62bc6c6597664e0ebee99a7 the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
93bdb754833d306450a122ff2ee879e5 i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
427470cb8bae9f4537b3ba74680cddd4 first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
f5cbb3d03ebbfc0942b32ad9a8187168 the radio feature has superb sound quality .
7589c75efb2663f7280de993fe911740 it has a classic design yet looks hip .
10bcb3bda84444e8fa4320cb8f64d4a5 it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
17cc6d4ecf34b6e4ca099958ffdf2dbf the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
74ab0cc3f6e22fc34b2fa57efbcb6936 this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
dc93b572e66d7cee8d1301ab1059f27f the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
df3688691b10a0e73dcdfb792b8e30b1 it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
ff02148f541cf5f18c7b9c51fb6d96d1 i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
9bdc0ecd4ba875ebf8ed1079a79dfba7 battery life is good for a phone of this size .
098307584fe79af946e39aa07c80c5fa but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
c580e8b16d0f0c69d6f4a6852f64e367 great screen and great sound .
8f5fb743985c046f487e684660404026 the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
5f632c925abff8ea973237469d07a2aa the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
5f86510c019b5a8471a682edff4d3332 the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
0b54732d6bd649e17ed65361c1e1f178 my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
42f9a3d24c13151b0c3eee5b5a85dd48 this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
437957753d095bc51aec7470946afeac other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
25c37ec2c74bd5e51f8e37c5a996c514 finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
d6e2565e3aff0093275531850416b504 their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
c942e7617c5617c46364266d80a29f69 the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
743eeb5f1185f0007cd790563f3abfc4 after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
f18154e30404fb3775505cae4d99fcb0 it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
38ea99941efb67acbdadb452537a05bc unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
2444c9bfc1b6cb142560eb1ebb714654 when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
f1215750c4fec903ffd2520c9d49c960 the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
8ea22abcafee5d8784ac48d7824ecab7 the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
3f4a8a9f30c37af03527a36fda76d179 you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
dc8970a7ae3535e224c0efcde6cdc284 the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
6678ea63baf21e42ca34ff9c60e47c7c the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
b3f9fc452f442086e1d960c66db4a767 one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
69bbdc0410ef3b4436ebce2467ecc1db all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
58ea739e6968cb14d68aa3dc440de4bb the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
73641eedb3d433bfe6a0c4832a6a2ded this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
bab7c888a49b92e4221b1c4a319f20de nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
5e74b4c1331cab866091f6646439932c with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
cb424d3ece8282ce9d98ff9e19d23c6c the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
4c97fb16f6c98310c527b30aa33a2434 the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
2d9f1d8d7f3c3a79a868f38dccd16782 this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
29ed127ae5b09fb6a770cea2c209ccf6 the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
f814470075f9eaffe13f9b92b246daab it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
66e182597a414b07d8bf1b3a941514eb however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
0e81cf9c89d6ccfb13d2f4e90af872de when talking the voice is not very clear .
58d2a9f2d0c8ce55a5a4bf88152d25af but , i would definately recommend this phone .
1a6d1bdedc09f5bdc564a042f2d5a543 it is crystal clear .
a05eeda6733206f3896d450dd927f8fe this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
