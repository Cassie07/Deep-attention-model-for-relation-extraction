9a1063a3c621fc3e1daeb5407582a281 while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
c82c21709baec114aefb66dd64126f64 it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
ef25a24c12ae7b697445f8d181fbe847 like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
009a83596167fefb74ee4f99f3da73be the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
03570c7476d0ceac93f46ac37f238d57 i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
7e390d99990520159331c2210f335e00 another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
ec3e6b247f6122e9e8e67e6c3e169ebc the software is great .
57033fc830bf16bf7d5880910f3510c6 transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
b054d89158181f39fbacb882681b0a47 even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
15a7c1725a6f3133066f8d0f949ee8de only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
415686bffcb3cfc6ca44c45ef701e46f i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
41fb201e96b0a4471c1d5968f0e2bbed they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
348be60d292983fa6e0032edffb24477 get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
7776b0f87b81121c7174a41c852579a9 i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
a47093dc8287a8f274c8d63c78ce45d1 software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
4609198e9495aeb97d0e1704b1f11136 much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
d0b9db1d064aee4b746b67671efad50e you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
2f0c579001ddf9a71892e54a7ae11a15 the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
21324ba4087ec89d5867ec3d3cbed878 navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
f44741557e15a6d5aa4732d78cf51b01 at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
50815ed54fda64a996bb08d62d2a7a46 the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
d774bf064dcc434889cc18e434544697 so far the software for the pc works easily .
0aa7689b258533c7181e112c5660d045 by the way , it looks nice also .
a9abebef8e1ae2a86f69844d27b2ef28 it 's worth it .
9f6a7f7178e78442ace2e798b1feb157 my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
e9085eaf184831b80aff2166379e289a the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
708b44f9b368fe9a57d74533f002dd65 the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
027358c11edcbca4be06865adec2ddb1 the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
6a8f21acd626d0800eee6c1da079d11a it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
97de56d8b2c770f71d198ee46e6dacfb the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
c35cec64272467bc85a2e0ad72807549 it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
a92fef16203e6547baf7dd20d024590d the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
046321e6f46dfb8659079eb3d885696d other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
c17dc1715e1475263f7052f45d238a95 overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
2781ec21a03150c5581bbc9dcb056d24 ( batteries last longer too ! )
93b83dad8de467af70db727ec3d5cebc the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
24abd4ca4b2e2dd4bcb7e9533280f5ce i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
04e75cc628aa27f6c3276a1f03b28daa the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
c8a04e62ab057c0a7bce58982ce6cae8 the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
68a9b8ffda36ad44922fd9094de3d7c5 all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
afaf39071b52683e17764f148e9d31e2 it 's a very intuitive program .
6ae486eab43b12fc48eb5ebd137a031d i had no problems following their installation instructions .
505eef725abd66a7fe0622b6840e6127 the menus are very easy to navigate .
ed1d75903ea482b77ba64b695153809e the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
2bf6cfc96b5bc5542cd4ad34261974e3 the other controls are all very easy to use .
8833bf0170f0cbdf97459663d8a659b7 it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
d8fbb9053ab6bfa846842cec9c7375ac the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
473d6a40c6b646993c0e24a7288860ec it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
c6a901cdd637a0656a4f254ad26c16e2 the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
626cfadc8b25761d5ae0b438886a2491 they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
366990c55e8589617438949b2756f2f4 this is a good deal for music and data storage .
27f13efb1c6d5d29bb29db0c4901feed the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
5d8092a6d765cfc489d62935e6d8fd12 the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
781e98709ecc8a7dfab7d9011bee8474 the player itself has all sorts of problems .
d9d99ec938a1b158a7d84e95b5ba8279 the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
400ce68405be88bbf3a3ff061cc1beb8 the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
a8ab51fb70878af0b625fce02e4bfcdf the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
b4c4b96fd48905f15ca7fc99ac5c6ff1 depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
9b424d6365bac0f4f17ad2c4236e8f08 the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
891f63e1c470263e3ffad09e6a6969b0 on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
20ba4c4b32823c2ce57fa535aeed926f i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
b30b5b6479f3c4d4f013169b4b75028b overall , a very disappointing product .
65d57e5a4311b045168d50ce95763aa8 the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
64af7a62dcc6e958a42efdd79f3bff12 the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
d2a9bfb1e9ed4d4734bd522814d495e6 although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
7b7d04dd9eb17d5a2a93e72824918ba3 when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
779a3476686e17329f2fc937f7fa7b1d one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
4b250e429d4a6e61e0e17bdef799bb3f other than that this thing is great ...
65b5c536d6d91c394bc8b7ba532235ab zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
ead02770ba3fff710bbb69f23f20558b the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
1be79d7a5a11f8412ca2fbc51b782117 deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
3a7359c228b14d5af1256761b5c276f0 the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
66ce466af1383f7ed6c6c49cbf3bf433 i love my new nomad , its great !
4fec9c067b66f205e88ef11ec78e607e this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
ad451383a8f52970863fb60b1cd69f44 for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
f339b39fbea7fe7baa1418d143d3cfae the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
8a31ba51febce8f3d665f6e34835eb2d the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
c8196ec4c983af49734af374c87665fd on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
eec2ea24e9d430dfa7c739b7564618f7 but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
a262ec3d23f82c740a50e07ca9e10925 best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
9750fbfe05f0f6190913afd965205095 so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
c2ad557043d4ae463fdfecbd9d8c997e just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
a69be08b63d42739c3ce2d21b092d767 not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
7f7d5340134c877da3bd1bc01ec4bd9c very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
59c5e163592f43c01c63e0e38f92aa82 the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
6bff76f5401264648b027c7bc10b42de all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
c4e796d80648ecc51b638ffb194b05b7 the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
9f235bc4fe0b25cfe6ce4bd9e0035c54 lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
4fb822aa6d5fcde57fa8d260e22a9770 navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
f1d894ebed14f332b5be805d716739ef also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
53dd0ffd9ecb990b926245589712a547 oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
b258b3810cfda0814676b2df0ebe3351 another plus in my book , no file limits !
7f29f0fe969c8fc60fdc28661dd9739a i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
9049e58cba05fd68265cd9050c703271 i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
6ba0d129dee2cef84aebe03c9cccb671 i really have no complaints over this unit .
f1ec074964c5a280f73dfd66022b0269 i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
782fc2a612ee16ef9a514ec7e35802b2 getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
fcd373c9245e6cf2b0b35bf8a793932b also , the instruction manual is very bad .
d3ce1590bf181d8757fe6b288af73a66 i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
8c74d8151055a091c61880af39665d93 getting files onto it is quick and painless .
d3d0480db545710bfeb04f0a7e77e30c then sorting the files is easy as pie .
15b815592f0c46787eb83026ec326985 and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
2d44c35b69371d301623b04044ea5a11 my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
ba92443cb9a6e3b3c3a9255183b1c671 also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
dda5363374c02d2557ecec9085e01651 the battery is nice .
80e11640737e6ee1cc2902f3c818c14c the lcd screen was very large and readable .
b4710055bc1a10f777d1a193f72ef944 compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
f2411c8e4e34052a33a2a92ad250283e i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
cbaec5e1d5d11423c1b9022283a65123 transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
0f2374d58e39320546bc65d19df970fa it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
0a6d08e7c3843ce6c1cd49c684cfb9e0 scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
03f1651d264a21651b42a1041db57dbb size - bigger than the ipod
87c5b70d46d6b4cb5476f4a5c2192289 software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
9f2d19f4f15b79be42e96d4df6d23921 sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
7dc900e5981655de08215321d314835d i love this player .
8a3ba7aa568e5ba7f52dd29d94632d4d all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
c7f5cceaff97a5d0b302626a5fbb9eca i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
d81555f22735886788ea73f1132e3c36 the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
9b386fcefb830e15c2600e5d99a60f18 anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
074a0ef9795ec5883cc9095904d96eb4 first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
91ef64f99306ceccefe758a8342dad1a way less expensive than the ipod .
4d8ad44b1b14c1b2e414992de2d17bbd i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
851613aef4dc3542de9dbdae5f08f0c4 the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
2b7f3c26f25073ec589dc565a9b05a45 and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
ab72638a942345b2a65db3fe67536bb1 not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
723ad8c86d5e6981a66aaea2d044ebdb bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
f54af8c6eaea5babf0d100b6d27b68a4 i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
9f6b415cf80c10d2805f6645440b9fe9 both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
341900728bdf68f6d26118c42768752f ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
b6ad3734805d45028aacb33df91f1f38 people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
6dd8fd06e074f6961f2341d48405bbf4 it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
26afbb728550c0df1149e771bc94d54b the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
68a8302a084952a7e1cf8fe9f3f14b4e you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
f57610696a8c7bcfd48e157cbef09feb the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
fc1353a755e02d2292608b3ddaa8e8fa my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
2e9c5b1a86f4dbb60d971706c9a6303a all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
8b9a6cd9df31ff13ae9cf191b5e2455f but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
9cad5736da827e5d496c2741b7aabcef sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
7c5f2cad9e33dd876fe73ed5afd2c719 it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
25d13607a3d0abce285789e09dc8ffa6 bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
eb5f7f84fb72e7589f2fbebf5436ab11 unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
6fcaae2310ecf9ee59517f3666e15812 if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
ff59c7cf73f04bfbe21c7256237ad99c i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
5fb4b81a32ad9a445d62d0a28c23a37a the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
87d3bee71401883dd97af2ad9bf28ae5 i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
d640dd60fc3c00a06110c0f4bb84347e the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
83c0f79f8710192a88e6b91256723401 the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
f0c0c8d21d612bb7b910accde1d355fe now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
6d0ac44003c8f03b17f4e1adcc23e886 the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
700fa80ba3b1dc0ba3a6cfa6dac81f0a the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
287d6d68074e7ed50f20f43be92c4846 the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
9d4a8bd6c0f5e3a37a676f91296665f3 all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
fd02adeb0b3e3ad869f3f15173d5cd41 i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
953d167adfbea5165b5b374987f15397 i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
467f423739211c9d00072d3a6f9764e5 i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
9125350c090c470cfd3f5084ef7365fb ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
a02886b0e5a359523dc0cef529ff0f68 i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
16dccec07487bfb9e777d9b8fc08c377 being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
e24082bf48b6d19d32244d020b13478a when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
72aded7ea887df602a8ff0bb7045767d the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
adc10873dc7b8afd51047d4c479e2e65 actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
ea4fb8598a87486371fe751a009ec959 finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
814a355a03cfe25a41d31293be549801 the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
f7e215562ee1a9103ae0258748c464f7 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
d7478b34deba4a702ad54db5313471ee just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
0e5f67b050553dd76a766dd94211c505 nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
8812abd94f2f4829367b5c99303eebd1 all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
4445ba29ed92b3fd3c0b931e302ac58a the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
b2c12395e7baa4db094eb94137f35655 i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
a38439d7c15e4548fd748f4b11dd2e65 - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
80cd91becab34ccb67f67ec535af548e the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
45609991a6c8a115b87b71d4c3620b77 the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
feb7dcbbee6a06823c848eca7460da73 - included creative software is pretty poor .
867804e0f600290b55597fc61d92689b - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
c2c86cf57832cdfe9528c3894a413821 - best in class sound
7491b52ccd6cdf7fb6cb7dd33913b3c3 - large easy readable screen
eb7618dbcb52171ae616abad1d389f2c i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
f40793c38a74c3360a2488bb5907dc28 it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
913332dbee7c09d79b4e2d89d50983e3 had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
c0c49b5e07dfb28a57f97d6e493293c8 working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! !
c006a83533e66ba4d3f6a6fb70f33d5a i love it ! !
a565f0599a6ba4e48225839871d8a87e this product is too fragile for normal use .
122cfd2b8bf7fbd7aa5e8c6241d5400f i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
0bc7e90c6f8562629f5338ddab065f25 however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
4b6a08ee430cea6d15e1cd66fb525897 the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
3c5f59db1e69e2a5265fc983a5c721dd if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
927a14f889b6993f5079b0034e9837d6 transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
b7417a11cf288e47a567e3ecde685427 it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
042d659e2571a54ac6dd267df5c94471 i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
918de59c61c94ae7c7291788af1fdf09 i love the storage in this thing .
a2ed6396e069d1c46f3c58e369a0131d this is ridiculous .
3abd36a093b4d29d8ac8f30e864f6b39 the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
77ab5c078e0af731a6045f5d94d84250 seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
4b422478d2bfe45105ae6e24c6b27e46 the interface used could be better designed .
e3d1318ec7e52fad18ce1969533e863b it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
9d2b6df35824844c6e9e5f23b3c8b700 and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
22ebf8ff0a22607cb8ecaa016b7baa85 it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
d65b4f9868df8c7ec371d1551ba95d22 the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
9a5ff981c0dff7796b50a095fa7da2d0 despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
5a996de6fa199031b74d07478f52342e however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
79c1116733a016587698daee6f3b36a7 quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
dddabe0a6ff5deb6dc9e3641be46c42d i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
381645b8c5e4a5a766692ae2bb576665 this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
f041070426ec31a080e77c74f9f5ee0c 1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
2e09cd1f8010f95983f90fce20da6fe7 2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
fa3ed2bde213bd0078bffda62730ce6c first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
cbfc89f77439980882d812d4eb68bc5b the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
ec45f347a448e896c123cf2716a5bcba compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
10daff17b8c852005892b07d4f5707d4 to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
e74da56b82a743addc4bc80ccd353906 this thing seriously is a good player though .
25a208137ef94897495c53c7c6c312e9 overall i like the unit .
375771ef80624dd9cee2e3d841e87373 i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
1e394b3a762361b846c8fb74a2f0ab0d 1 ) price / gb of storage
40a8c57eae2ae7248199788fc78077e8 2 ) storage capacity
5c950f0f68fa5bf13fbe33d9b8b6c3c8 3 ) user replaceable battery
91145772645dbac2150a156b427debe6 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
959602bf89ca279673672e006f510673 2 ) scroll button / switch
daafc75e6bcd6fce195af9664df50625 3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
496e26a3365c89dfc91e58db502603e4 overall i like it .
70bd3a733134156690cb111c55c3822f the storage capacity is great .
5e3b041ac6b9ad8129dd2adbb704bd4e the price compared to the ipod is great .
c797f7ccd54badc9e0db79b7ce27861a price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
a20c4c03f7b95629a438605bd146c7e8 but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
66557bcc85255c9c99db64f66a4f71e7 the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
a12e05ae90f0af9ab3f5d1f078ae000e i 've had no problems with the software .
70ff2f0d4be123db393f5baeac245277 i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
466b2b66490e54cfaf5eba8253102481 this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .
63b8144d6c2c174572bc050cfbd0ae2f the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
1275816028be42ce14dd06e59b53b586 the sound from the player is ok .
7514d5166ea3e0be58f2730e04aeb499 i was a little disappointed in the low end .
622d2b0a51584ebe2c7e4f21d9ba1330 the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
d8ff3cf9ce8d5d89e7aa7a5896373419 this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
20f7e57ebd6596546f8333a55a35a444 one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
4f24be526a9c92068894b12a0079407e for the price and features it is really good .
76dae912cf2b027c4d69337edb58cb0f in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
371fcb1667fb81be4f3ab2087f44f90e you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
aa755efa485b6b2983cdb9916e3def2b the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
a07ba4c61197603df5d0eb7207abc1d6 i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
061fa6633540533196c8541145f80a36 so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
0cac93df8a2f02f382f143955f4a4cc4 the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
e2f94b0cbce83921d5370e77d5c2bea1 longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
3eab72409ccff3c92556a10118277041 i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
00678fc65cf74c7bbfb5bf91f2796a34 the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
9b738839dfbee4e8db71a1dba60aa00b the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
6907bb010dae76e44e07aab7d20e448a so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
47e00dddb792058b58b4ebf4d83051fd this thing is trash .
24d93015399c37ff908bdb60c3adf6b2 a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
b9063ee5751791fa6c9c7c2cfb04d687 b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
8e5d48144e2352fd121ac7d430fcfb1c c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
2155dae2420356df58f64bd1e973732d d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
7dced1d79c48c3ee36577dd998895d1a e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
53a91a3802fc40bbba3c21c7e9355215 f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
2bbf8f59d3110e4a4954aca45035a23a the software failed repeatedly .
b53d62b6c1ff43f2a9f455b5b47ac453 creative labs customer support website is useless .
59b4d091b5111df77bfdded1137bcc19 software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
7c2743ecc6a2c318b795bd38984a1f6b i just bought this player today and i already love it .
3f80b7a14d7a065c04e3f57cdc652c24 it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
b54b42cf02a97a211cfa0d30cb043a56 another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
dea66d5317b71869a95016784c1b70fb otherwise , this player is awesome !
22b951ffa2f0d17cc9b029bd85dcdf41 it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
ef17800065343e65f25e6b2d1f306115 the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
f6623d38bfdb0e14da4f30b48146d4e8 overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
27317b7dd8e10acd65ff29d6c4b85acf i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
44f2a23eb1e67de5a88009265ba81109 naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
f685a3a0947843463825e1bb031ce248 compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
fb178e58423217eaa289bebf7a6aaa1c - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
8bfc9a0d448d241bdb06f31c4c4b1541 - the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
2af163caa9d46e522b350f3b11f88a74 - uploading music is quick and easy .
fbee1b6fcf7db29b9cb6d9e03ae53a38 although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
268205ed2adbfd7633dfbe6593bf4edb - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
4da67439931b4151fac755d4b598dfbc as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
fcc6060d8953928ffecfa28e3e7a7871 the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
0d9ef93f4b9430a1a5d9813011b8bc79 there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
4bd98e3804be5a792f3b30af064b63d8 - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
f1290f48d5e61412db6946468d071b5c also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
fb3aa19e10f1dae6b9413cfe33af040c - equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
e1ad1a34c613db2ca633d3d78e5f2be1 the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
c086e6c5bbd8763f8374f31de758012d the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
995acd474024ab5500649725d2b02aae this player is an ideal purchase .
937380945b7a721b7403148d0d455e73 the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
98403a16cdeed60e2113243a13b306bf i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
a361394cdc6999e5a0fe06836b4e3951 on my main computer the software did not work right .
cda6829d2d0bec30cd8f8fce149c66b9 i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
25e9ac3314edbb22f429a90632829517 i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
9182663809b6095073a7d5f7266c9609 so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
7150721b427e0192c769d0a753de63e6 i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
f9ddf9883a3cf622da12c862e0d82fc1 it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
f744e4fb9058b980763743190fc727d9 the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
4669d00c8621e9a0281e783c77782dd4 the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
a7a2a63d634d00419baf9b30a158cbe5 the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
a0025c0db7ea0540259cd3b1b90d7fcb the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
ac35a2b46c21e2344be10bb8fcaad509 the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
44d22a9ad796160bb6beb7100f6b8152 the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
707fedfc4c9613f12097a5dfa04edc8b the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
3d5f68099b5d17b2d10ecc955837f5ab the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
b13571b4b8c661704f8e4595b257babc lastly , the price is fantastic :
1e7796b52864f44323808bc0290064a3 i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
91ad73748bd9e99a388bab39811723cf usb 2.0 - very fast
c90109759bcc96a15bb07eb055a6fef8 yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
de8c0ea32caab8f743c60c243bf98ff9 but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
c6f97139fb91a3ccbffcf8da7abc8a93 and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
381e0bc5add64324e7dea05c1857140f it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
2cb65646de9a97d0b4b05d72225ee6af the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
d7df22709616a3e0f27dc38f0cd7a8a4 i am very pleased so far .
839017bf38fa97672e96ca48c5695a3a very simple to use .
534cc711fb7497cc8a9f2de24a929ac6 1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
ec0fd99b6bcbfe936b9599e58eacb322 2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
1d1779b5fd4631148758949a356271bc 3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
98cbbe99adab2c7b6c6ec4ace851e125 all in all suprisingly easy to use .
5a9e2c56b3e4e5359842e5b8ef87d675 lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
8569a7dfb307c605d7ba9f01dc118762 excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
ca693a4c5df2c07f651e149646f822a6 transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
d9373416910359b8a385ab071d81a693 i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
1a660d93ab7bcfe1d1d3d39c1c3b80e0 huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
b3664a72fc3d4305b40c634c0706c9c0 having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
513d68e23304b9a241c2496abf036c5b navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
ee3d512f6f723bfb5e505b58c066f07f fm receiver - it has none .
dfeaf50d5e3cca7bf889853664f868cd cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
0e57ee572cc132a512fea07060c57adf the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
53c7c4556903767966dbc5683f8b126b as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
abb0cfc406cfd076ce7bde7f7535876d the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
1570c8057aa673cb966b476bc21d70b2 software - the software is crap .
1537f5c863b8c8d881e3a30c0a61533b i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
fdba5339167ee65d8d36a7954a19f4e7 otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
08ab613078229543daf0da24f79ad268 even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
a98a309574a160f4441fb8f055688779 no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
18776b75386e5e4b1a8d94034da05d2b it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
d92ad8231981f8b3759771615f2c7a6e controls are a bit awkward .
5fc4daad600577af3465414cc6346fde it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
b306d893d4abfe8c7f979a77cfff7a5a crappy headphones .
0474d0b6a9b1c4f3d8293ffb0fbdcf6b the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
8aa5d60d1152572e6165890c76430ad6 difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
6f6b408df12cf2cad628e4ee2887ebd5 it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
245b770b06f6add5b1166b48a60a543b i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
af3486cf11b465100e02244c4ae682ee up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
1675736cec8dc2050229791dc016e3c7 if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
9c8b087ba299dc92014adb3b0c2157ec it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
a5a636df118fc8a27663f81f5d541375 as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
9bb5da171d4b7a693a388d71485b3f7b overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
5fd8c0085bdee242af47218a4dee27e1 i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
5a2480b407a86683ba7b4076ad5e09f7 for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
a5f896d9ee945727e18197eca9a18380 the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
80bbb11678af660f0125fc0dd5f8324c simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
3d4574448c311e0ea8e5b1e7ad6fcdda but the major problem i had was with the software .
b044707a805daadf2f4c1d1c24fefac8 the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
445b54a1e60413834b2b823f3b73a305 the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
9551fc8f3d50538de5b346accd0212fa i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
d1f779c0a4484ba66d43fb877ca475d8 with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
da922c938e7f865a42ddedacb2b59143 i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
a6e8231ff9a167e8b61fd68df9915109 i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
911cf34fb4622eb08d94512ab5c12964 the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
0a09b863b5f04c01db59378ac1f5c8f2 the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
0cee0a56b66cdebe9d6e2c1f4c4a4f1d the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
a8ca5ff27bcb6526b194c97f24e7c6f2 took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
4e1901d8d28af75fad800cd14641edc1 i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
f6bc4fd24b9be00f5b099c30cab47b22 all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
2c92d650e105f7df5d4390b5bddf0006 it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
01b06273acfb1e183ddcc7f38cb5108c i would recommend this product to anyone .
b2d4e633a50cce494eea7a203213e6b5 before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
205ba48000827a3b49562499e168cd48 many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
aa3b4b93145f716321721fa859b6e463 the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
8487498f2b6e44dd82814b6515fd3e74 the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
44113db332ebb2a7be2326e83dd6db5a the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
370f2f08bb8ba98db88f94c031ba3f60 the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
08c55a18e9f4a2e76d4f25dff8474868 the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
10d9cee24af6c9f6d40cb101d17311ca playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
5d8a1adbeeaf90d9f03da0b3810f9ee5 the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
b103dd660ac27c42f2bf467a8b3e0878 it is an extremely cool gizmo .
e3acb2699c9fc9220bd3f2c7f00ad5c9 the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
c7593f31f905682ecd393eb33a006c37 creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
fe535202f32e00ddf80d23a8b9e925a4 my only significant complaint is sound quality .
6215fd62148ab8893a49df9183f109ed the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
5752d425fd230241f15f09a3ca7c1c62 i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . "
ada231d490de7ffd5bb32453d86341b0 well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
d7971a11f5508d7b68fd3dc153dd2301 well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
56b0b55a8c6aba813e567be6d65e17ac well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
c88fd1bd55cbc6db568d9d4bfcf9d80b not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
64808aa3e2de10a6042780e5a0f4f992 it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
07c7902d501403f2cfb77c7bc163b9a5 my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
4654812eec1f697a9f4ce1e9c75d2a2c oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
3b783a61d1de4aeff5e2bc59e9014361 a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
e2339d4288da175346b059be2786fc8f it 's easy .
6ad951fc0c6d2c701335d2ce44de0d5e the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
e4ac12789200e32ecf5a324b1e5e7bb1 the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
c2d8dd4f0d593e4f1ccb35743b4a76bd my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
0c26d5dab827714b016b99e34bf679be its really cool .
e49ac9a4b66e14c04595bc27e7a4d260 sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
74c4c6668d03af5e9d849d423a5b8aea you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
c97f7f5032697d824bf0078278432617 but the earbuds suck !
0995bd9fc59fbcf1a0af1bf0c0da9dce i forgot , the case does n't fit .
c990b6b1103f5a85ae4afcfa4dd6d607 my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
d67db5a6180bd82bcfa586ef5b5d069d also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
dcec7d045bb56bb23bf6af62e977a87c first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
2f8f641471bc4a57cee5c14765184d56 the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
3e406d6f8231c62cced3fc27d645b1b8 what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
7507936ccfd024868889a9ca39083bf9 bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
2bfd3a824c2fea33fd6842c8e668b829 rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
398cb319769bddd6c91cb1051d7c2e26 this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
77d109e2cb75e81b27de5ba3fb01ee7b the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
09c3718456bd35ffb165e309bdc179f4 while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
fbfbef5022d2d4b5ac455d2b19cfa830 i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
3dbd647708d95a1f6f35a1c61bf4414e it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
44aac534139f6cc1bcd1ef00cfd82ffc the storage capacity is great for me --
bb25f76c14b817eebcf952611ddb3014 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
38f952b38b8952f328cbb8e5d9009415 loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
1245c249dd265d331140ab5a14e99d42 my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
aa33d939f98b42cddc9a95271279c4a3 other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
2d3a5b4f342988ecdb571049d90c9e77 also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
1ccdd0a015af2bd4872573b4f49a3672 finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
04a3677e6506bc41864956e4153811e0 the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
f047713fd7ebf2002c5bc05f4ab2df80 a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
3cb890299f26d6981ec2eb0866b852f3 first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
f8e21ab1b8a57bce5633ca8027b19bb4 the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
367132e3bd707c6fcb4fcfefdd6d2de8 second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
43eb564042d7bba0c26ccffc54663aaf the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
54724dd286a492837cf9f736f866a74a third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
57a74e8be8d489d3048ecdc5e9e62e81 only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
af4ff3b60fd17fb4f6c20eea30e59606 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
ab5959c7a51807b986ce61bb5891c023 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
ff1eecdd80a1f9b940854cd224a25989 it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
1d9343fe416a6e32f7610f814a6aacc2 if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
ca1082e52c74fe20465b83cd64f2464c its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
44e1e4bb7c4861ff76642a41ff4b5d38 i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
c12383bb97c5145343b5078c02d465f5 the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking .
b48feb7e6209e47420ac1cab656ae710 the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
a88ee172e70d1886ca28bcf0b5ba1d06 as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
294fb4d5c0dbd66ee87636a29c8f6923 the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
aeaf53d9981fcdae134d914c14c3bf3a overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
3d98a205976ec0e232aa4bcf14021d0b this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
b24bda91f521ad2ca3847636eaba7568 it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
16ac12ea22acb0865fbe839e4b386158 the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
32e6a85af80efb34ff9b87e875a6720c extremely convenient .
9875f6fe729cc22fabf62ec61986b351 great price .
6d07f4207f4fb66fa8b28f912a9de794 i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
7c980ce6e3db331419916b5538ddd428 the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
ccf988e0634ce521a215b506d58ccb6e it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
c85f223da0d1ac8cf5ad9da86277af73 i 'm really happy with this purchase .
ecc2a0ecdcd48e0d7d52b66af830f9f0 i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
21ebed2a97f528417ad5da338ef26ef7 now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
033b35286cae2ac0ec2fc080f51e500c there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
cc2a5126d27ea1de2649523d3ac82c6a but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
8121831049060e4e814eb90a284743c5 ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
f0839623df1f9e3b0e9fb72b70500897 its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
00b26e308a4b8730247f6846646d008a its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
75e1b73b9b5ceb1012b702373a089440 it also has unproven battery life .
7967db31bc77438a94a846ddeb630669 finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
15d9cf3e39596240efc9e3ba0c79e5a1 * price and capacity
1410831d46d56db6a5d5e35d549b0839 * slick-looking design and improved interface
acdaa29179a637e892dd726100d6557b * removable battery
ad71306ca9a64f28e317dd789b8d22d2 * protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
55dab1cfdddd4a895855e44900c1da52 * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
ca72c2fb4eef254b80c4d2051a89c457 * eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
e781c09e3c443732c8f53703efb0b736 * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
3a0a5560d7bf0fbf314c2dd2947318db * software is absolutely terrible :
33f231b9745e1d5d1ef2a29379d0825d -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
2c56bc9b793294d7e71cb2a6ca92bd76 -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
b2e9195b55b3d4ac0429cebac50af3a0 -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
97e094a508427d2e9e048c7e86aae737 -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
3fd077cfdb53680671d6b273e8b56c20 a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
a73d14c0989545fa526660433bb1046c despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
c82d2cdb00de9ac0588234c023aef4ca i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
ea2c514a36f45b31b1c75ee1b8e84f0b file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
9a0d7726564146fb03c68fd115bed324 my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field .
ee31d7df41f71e9ae037cdf06e1512c9 to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
1815e3af4f811c08b874fb48013a9edc the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
4571ab0de8e8a459a17e954063b78c9d navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
d8737e5e75f38be5112109d102d4da02 at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
67dc1e53421cee63213841049f1d434b i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
a14a922a3325a69475213f69d9c1a3e1 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
8eb5d2fca4a827e8e326a4df00c9b809 the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
23437ff0a6808a5975343315b39f966d plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
e36d6c54ed710942569ac8dc47ef1c8b the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
2505b3eb37eb261c8202ec3d03ef5c52 ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
4eb5f2954876bf5f8cf65bf5ee5d832b considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
bdc192fe7f1f8ae65e2026ddd253541b it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
4fb1cfe789fe3b6adac7a3197959eeff after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
f53180de30a7308dfce4f7c6df47edae first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
700f48300fa8def127637b87e04b7e68 it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
241e92f11d46769e40d74aa4b77795f6 the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
4e2e70820a49ac08fe4e3c87254942cf you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
39cd7109f8321f41f52bb1e4faa244b6 and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
68dfe1e6439e1d2fafdd1dcf2ce1d498 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
632c86be964171dbcc6fda361e4135dc i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
bc7eb770198ec23ce9e6954c28d75f24 they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
6aed866da58eea721927bebb9ef3ee6e i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
f99faf2dfc3e8af6f1f6221e99b19533 however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
dea30bd0a5bde7f25c08bb9e1ae9417a also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
e17e18380718fc3b0a9d1deacbd92ff8 this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
3e72e9cc6e251da6798a2e9e66feb5b3 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
f6f88d89f1bb907351dcee2f580dfcba the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
14d20e2bcf29b6bcafa9483b929a2de6 1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
159b67abc278328bcccc6d17c611028f mediasource did not recognize my tags !
c08ea81dfd0032ff6d47afa0112ba4c1 2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
d6255391e01cbaa0b68fdb9cf3e4e183 creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
b45fbddd121d5a06ac46d216611c9b71 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
2264f719eb82749d362e807f6f91259d 4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
8c911f0be96ba4560218d1f4847f02a8 in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
808ad6bcb1ded63956522c023402f206 5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
7ab7a3fdf39cb28801ac1dcd470adf13 but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
55a1e032f3ca37204ac18478c6c689ef 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
48c0b3b084cbc34f0220be2c1e263f02 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
f17720aeafd313670cd2350bf2e39041 m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
2f4b1a4eefb0c421b14cc034af6fd056 given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
ec340f06e0eb73c2159cfded9597e7b3 now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
834d0e9c671269bb32128ac11d774061 i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
97c7ba01b8d251276d4c9b11594e1473 the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
76697d1f74e7bf972afa33e74ab84613 it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
caaffe4038166ea49a2981e5138d812c i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
5713f609f1c720f88066bbaa337daca1 the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
496c1896b2e7b5f68f4a805a4611b9f8 one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
f6d65be6923c9fe3a8774db12bb405c2 they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
01d420339e8fdc70176a130eefe63552 i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
a2bf69fa2b4d66e2af70f0cd2cddeb9e + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
82652759eeb14565c17b62f071372bb4 + i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
86231998768f09496e0db50c3fc87fcb + screen was good , easy to read
b119b00ce9abadfc9d962e0350c310c1 + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
11cad0fb95b4ff543a79a44d44e25e37 - the software that came with it was tough to load .
3ecf8e7028ec31924c89c05143dfb770 - the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
6e9251e0ce409a341fcc88059061ef02 the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
7a7cd8ed6ebdbc8c995a2dea76a50865 - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
263d0a57e0a6df089c6e71aa7c3d8439 - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
cf83cabb7eb560bd752c9fd578c7b94d - this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
175f928d54b330b325141f5ed3a0c806 i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
15c31085c6c71aeacffc1df322ba7655 the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
8df2f7ba58c455f15ea3d272c2556f50 navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
602351ae5883dd3c1b0573f9071110ed many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
eab68e8ffd01e853dd876878b35cd2ad i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
702438ed98f2b97a5f63641e00164027 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
20d3a45cf59c04e869a7f7ce2fd28dcf i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
e69e578d052893330d9d3661ae730ceb the price / performance looked just right .
729e751ac2a70867a99c4929b2f6dabc i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
cef7009c693118f1f13f7521c361b2de i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
09d97450c691cb0d4d37880b6dfbc0f5 like other reviewers , installation was hell .
8c3c03154cbd83477cc74c833b045e56 about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
2462352e4d26f43439fa478ab33dff17 after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
6b0fe56556cb66f7b422b85c7053062d in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
a4619cbe6e195a5d789a4014ffe02827 to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
733ba9f5de9964818c2695925a6a4b5f it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why .
2b1f02e9b598b4335a04065124706081 i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
df460eaf582c2debf712f5605d908023 my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
107c4aa2469fabfd4d6c8e2c795a739f i will never buy a creative product again .
8854150f66545a6724f8fddff2cfd170 i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
3bf21a4b29d090cbd158c4195701fcd2 1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
ea750d90f9785597047a0e1fba8c7a2e with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
49c99b34744d9c137422c89b385c5e8b the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
dd00a38d580f6f271c19d5bf9766fffb 2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
bd0d2a7073e70e9587aa4596829a681b 3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
48f139b652aef71ed74e6e8e8af8aae4 the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
caacae279a3e157aa77c94186a9979f6 4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
4147498480996841498df2bb40d27af6 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
57a292f9d802d5e4ae08672ca7c95a16 6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
2372fb6a2b84de05a3b0daa7c5597402 7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
f68ec80438a497aca071cd7853ac8434 i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
6bc32f701b31d3e1398b32992b827143 8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
d6efa31bd4fb3ec50e425205157204ca i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
246990e929adc02ca90d4e883d21e178 b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
e9d28867f6cc8362413781bc3fa7002f c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
b78415d92f7b7efaa92d80a1f7c0e3ad 9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
954babd8405ad1c0d8d8c94cc7474e24 10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
2e3f4a9da60918bdc961149cf8e14d7f 11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
8d1f6697eefabe40a2bed7c33818a32d 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
077dde571fccc3e9a8613d40d0259dad 1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
cc3ee72e0899d1c615746015fea311ec 2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
be0e0a7720ad5ee47b7615913913b9f3 3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
201737d869c21044e5ddeaabacc4115b 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
8448fda5701874e7c112eea37250d87a 5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
967a8d9bc57c82103bdca1471b12db56 6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
fbe286401f006bebc697c734f2500a96 7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
00562a00a0ab2c377658f1ccf279b3bb great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
3bf7f4167edc15ec9e41d1fe2b1a2e31 not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
a30935ccfa2fca25f9a993b9e72d907d can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
e209739149213a4158fee5ab5bc87b15 also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
cd2b00075bdab04736edb20c3919a586 so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
7cc484b6f0b44f9a938b58a56252d88e nothing but hassle with this company .
4a8114950fa4f98cb3de53513afcef87 i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
682aa49b80fe174f1cddcc32da547cb6 replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
c59926d4de7d0d8aab8db084c3141f7d the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
48340a1e1ce257529f2396312f5aefc5 it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
67bd9ef657ec9fe0e24675e255e6ee0d headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
d1c69646c5abb52ea97b186a5217b56a the software sucks .
5bb67d6b0f270f6dd88cfaec1fa5ce90 also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
e28c0cbebda1e6a66642a879145af8dc i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
963946499f774ec9332f0bc2849487ec kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
c3343c3835f3c03085268bc260ac595b software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
bc08e98f66ff8b5d49eb77ff1cb0452f i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
3c142f3ad2ba81850af376a8769ae736 i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
fba2cf23926fa2aa67d2e28a09f712df i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
5edd2e3912aadfe55b64bee98b5416f2 i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
0c4de298f25d33f98c423488a7bd4745 always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
68836c3d5f466c5cc88a3db1aa84e3f2 i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler .
13ed9f0eb7cfb3f0871a1f60badfc088 the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
d60207defc4aa4824d6b29dc1c371a00 fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
a44b72ed937e77df7cb07d76f90f6978 sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
286acc904fd1e21d1add67f13bfad41a even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
f92d4e355a7e7406d4cef21d9018f276 the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
a0fdee29f22fcfa33ef66cdb8b74405c the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
555cdaa018e5b651305e027afa46e533 connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
d257e6733a09bb6d330841479452906f usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
d406da7c7294dc2ae57fc241ee00371d minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
dbc1a57bff1911a3cd8ebade561c88e1 the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
34df28625a94971b17a7a1a386bfe04c 2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . "
856dd7188c1d7af93cb6ce7425323b3e 3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
e823dccf754c11a8ec5a19b3ffb4f338 in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
eef08bf58ef6db8abb54f8fbeeeaa751 my first impression was positive .
9fab3fa1513794381fb4939e464dcc56 first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
1aadcbc62f9835b3cf41665c5eceb72c second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
db9a65f361d82bc676d6a2101487ca56 the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
4d48c9058303e08948d73947903087dd the general button placement is not very user friendly .
0274c135b199dbc2203f17aa3978816d third , the poor design continues with the case .
a885b5a985f79263561e8a12ab307a35 overall , a good buy for the price .
3ecab0f0f7b012bc1f10a6dda17f52bd easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
0e323c1547426b8da1e4e82d6f89a302 my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
5ff308be46611d62288a5557efa3016e there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
789463daf61441f5f2c4fd3ebd9927b4 i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
7c34e517718ef2880221cd7408e54f54 the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
3bc4feba5ac935dba2cf5229f7485723 at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
05b005a587509a9b418bc7b414f03e1b pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
6e60d87ee941a545e7c31d2faccc3964 battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
ea590102fe54b3305e3c92c7f680c4d9 creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
6749d9e57b3b07fe4aa63fb5d4051e1a what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
9962a0395a42bef512fbadba4dcc1ee1 feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
b9c3cfb01eca2d647b08e3a4c809cc68 the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
5665cc636f7aeff4e22e1cacfc8c571f the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
faecff2a9f98008034e071e9ea118f8f enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
595586dcd393895e2ca8c8a038c133b3 the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
7ffc66cb2e41eb23a6002a50ff28ff6e reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
94a5a92d5f0cebd27ea57141c33bd66d sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
673dd22fb3775b937ed0c3edfc1eeeaa but with a low price , comes lower quality .
6bcac49498fd30b88131b83404d6bfaf our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
8c03be28b2c6e81475a38f9d7773594a the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
21a68499842a9f708eb55a0f69984646 i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
73480e313222d36d17f0d77e2ea9d735 i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
66a0c26d06a2de11f1e77c0df92b5a63 removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
7e81a078a85a4e02906c1bfdb55cba34 value : comparing data storage with price .
13ff3f475a1d190111027f926eb4750a the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
a54036bc903c3a1cd6a4d867969199de the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
6fdc93d1d1fb8b64ab5bb713a74acb9f easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
1a3ae89d0d2443ff2dec1d8b3772dc43 the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
f36365781e2d87d761d5f6c5b23a90ab in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
53300d7a7dd55e15a9b1ca34d833f210 in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
ad033c1a3f9aede7296c967e3125b16f the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
39e04a3877da6e2dd43afd9b1587c5f3 huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
148b1ce6d32ce2ca6d79482fee329435 the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
a35aae065a501637e0500caa8560e498 with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
11ea6cc51cd764b97b163d2625b56407 if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
2c18484d512b4fc04c7dbcce1d30f543 i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
df802df13330b60399ef8b6c4a7f1791 battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
7e63cb8c38074e8e588f45686c470b8e when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
76e1f9c946b4e5b0f0c7e5da55e53d60 you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
4e222be5574201bad2e38c874688344f you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
70e416274d57af61bd643350514fbeb5 there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
18ad6637472a97bc27c037d097d32a99 there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
ce888bac166e88a3566b17a71d3ec5bc the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
c70fb67c5efeb4037aa2b2f54e618a66 the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
3d060f3950f61d0bcf49f47833b88c09 the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
648fbc07d2a2a8cf747e25741707426f the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
dd21167cb92bce0551aa2a38dcec88fc you need the software to actually transfer files
50db0cf84edf2ce76e2152697582c0d0 the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
8c032c66d536032e337c238887abfbdd also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
12a9609d2f9ab5d594c30af46279fe20 and also , it 's priced very affordably .
bbaf3f10e9f4fa129011180196717cd9 with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
eb88968921d7cb163079768a48fd733a the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .
0908662baf8f85d175cd9e342db17d3e the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
6c55c6a281bda2452ae8ba46838cc365 sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
8585fdca3941ac39596af3f196c491a8 accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
fe401e4c7ad5871abaee9660a3bbdd76 possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
60f14cbc1a1f1fba8df34fb32d3b3aa8 since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
78c51d9eb31454b8f9dba754a0353b4b try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
4c76049a09d1439c8cbb4195acbe94c2 i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
d4da5321b8fe9bcd7006e1a63d3366d7 i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
c878d78d4400ab65e3a924840f7fd73d price !
5eb85ac763d22bf04c5e505636188e0f sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
892483abe8f893aed943d349d2886f49 yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
652850fadd74debed2ce46db645d02fc i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
8c88f5804b903ab5b9cc7f24942c353f i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
20f4caa1b3acf788d80ee49ac27d76cd creative software stinks .
b1ea002e94262c6b402e3f320e945036 the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
3013b20a1a3e81cbad3c0c9d9769afe6 have had the player since xmass and love it !
92198989402e17a45ecbf5ef78c65e91 great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
bc8cb26f2e111e60b22ac940195a192f short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
a94aaabf3cef30309f2f69f92777dcf8 this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
b9bfe35c56e22b2e41d54ff0d9f5e938 for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
cc9343b9437cedbe76ed6e65ab813167 the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
c89290e4f08ad015ca64345fd0491bda it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
d8012015c19cafbf96cbc6cad5741bba i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
329396ddfb82ab13a6d35d524fa8b1d6 the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
549c7d7059064e5d04e7311335d378a8 the screen 's large and easily read .
af7b2475cec512242a1667f2af615f61 the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
a41a3006363fa471b7f43d1b0173295a sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
6c587ec84e8bea740d33edef4d6d427f interface - practically seamless .
76939677207f9e29ff3b3d4cf3842caa yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
0a00b74b0ff92b29a1f105bc7d87ff27 playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
bf0a5e500cc50d952088360876e9fd68 the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
c5fb91677140916fcce268347c2b912b as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
f83b389776371cf0534e0ea8cee0774f it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
10107c719f4350e78a17847611f5e6b5 the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
a1feb88ffe4cdeae946e399e8757f7d4 it was no problem for me to use their software .
b7a4b4086ff6f9e114fd0bbca4c9e6cc overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
ca88fee0f48f7e3af6abbce6bb924179 please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
cfe17418da865149723d4f155249429c do n't buy this player .
997ab59cbaef0807070bff4764f6475b unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . "
cfe17418da865149723d4f155249429c do n't buy this player .
0656a30c9ed3fb142df1a73db0d22f6e do not buy this product --
181a7b7896f3a5bc487caf123b3e4a42 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
e31dd62f55c1c30d4c665bd6ad5606e1 the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
b3362674852ddec1cdf253a98147090e honestly , i love this player .
25da27d72af155af06e6c5874f503ef7 once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
916cadfa5f20c518f90bad93eb6b8f19 however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
63b191a3a9ad3bc38caa73ddb3d65fb1 because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
e1e4d7cfd233964582a6deebe700e2b7 what a junk .
915a3cd71076181978eeddd26e184a3e every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
131c06e405096af26850df4554b4fdfe the sound quality is very good .
ccccff139fff46b68ee5e5d3b5f6720d the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
240d08ecef328811154a250d31b6af41 having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
3641dd852c1489c6a028ac79140227f1 typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
baf85a0b553ca7fd741513aae4904839 i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
e94a730e46252bda318d9e3325bfd892 the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
3dad728919e1b406d7295e3ca95a61fa the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
10f1280d616a081dc4bc341d9cd1fc33 the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
4bfb922dbaed4c0487fda5ae9f44e435 the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
c2ead43cc4af6f210ad3be6a5066613c in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
