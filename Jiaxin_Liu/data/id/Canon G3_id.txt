eafd66791e34c02db53c6c2d4b01bf38 i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
256c84e002437574427a138e66803e5f the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
2d1c8c82d6c2d5c21ee6177fe26d4fe6 they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
76a61e3a9c99f6dcbca0004f36642668 a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
66298b329dd1f88dfb52ab210c3cb820 i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
4a44a69cb955602ceffa932a795dd6aa bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
656e72834c7ff8e049c4a59974414993 i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
eae3fa8ec5597ddf6e714868e7a3068d this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
4f4ce92984a186b080eef02938290fa5 just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
8f2da3941bd227c6f14c4b153270cdd0 whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
215563975507a7e8899c222ac12a65c5 * main dial is not backlit .
182dbace3a6e704ea16ab6aaf5ee6811 * lens visible in optical viewfinder .
0f2a62d9de6e7304dc0dd5139dade1cf overall i 'm happy with my toy .
fd67a8e85f570b024dd73bf89d57c402 in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
0edeb8de7afc625a933b4c41f00abaf8 i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
bf908af716a65d7e256b4ea8aeccc8e1 with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
cb09687e3f277e84ad47f09f17b2d882 i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
619a3094f2477185a762954cc7609bf0 i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
53ad4baf0995d0de9a707cf242ae5fe5 i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
8125b34510fad206a46ff327585af3a6 the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
3dd55b27114ec5fd6815b8c30aa6e44f the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
3d44c865026753694c91909c1268f652 despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
f221ac367372a9d0142195a8c2d6879c i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
333577d10a0d5606224f46a9898698e1 the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
59f52f20810daeb20e7de7d2425110e7 the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
1a0d68ac376b768e92b8dca25c428ee4 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
c9a1ccede0c517d9a890c1dbe5559a48 excellent range of metering options as well .
493500669cab1a2ef28578fd9b1d5279 it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
ede478b04f16c8d0e4aec9e3f6e127d2 2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
0e6be374d76b6035fc000c221a4e5d9c 3 ) 4x zoom is nice
a61e41eb5761ad4e06fb2512a93a94e3 5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
744bdb63eb27c487cfb368662c9dcc70 you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
22bc2577b6b6173ed0c38a95bc8f228f 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
6762d97c1ca56e4f066ef29920a56073 2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
efe861ba1ba0ffd310e1e5335e5852a0 4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
922bdfb560dc1c43d64652c25daaa354 the camera has a wonderful set of features .
59eae132b2cb15aee8885c0e6c8856d1 the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
96a3c89de3083b68a7e7476e1f55d023 the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
41a7310667e145525710b6cac52c2c41 the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
bd6e7dce4fc34417032ba104211c56a2 i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
2ba780a3839b97663494b0fa5de97d11 the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
aa040e2aac44669936f89ea50c0ca0fe the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
66817f1a7ea8fb5f8cfe69f9bb6c0c2f the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
92a84f4bcdb0e8397f661e972a956f52 it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
9912ee61adbc16ba2940f26778c640d0 recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
2cda4bc7420f9d9ce26921a41fbe9f75 advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
fd4b6a0cabf9bc153ad62af16b426e57 newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
eb9a1fbd573dfc4c6bb5d2860fe69826 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
4c5719a60c8bb78b21a56b75862ad9e9 those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
7f28bc07721c2e384997b2808526e775 the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
07b3bdbafaec9f6df8f50960a8c49f11 i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
5e8d37c7fc800e394540cc47e42d3496 it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
ffba0d840beb51172340e31591b656ce i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
ae0aed0b3b73dea5b4506576ff783dcc this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
3053d1cbf4ec4303b5664147f3905050 the prints are beautiful !
20213c2657b8735b886c7d729880f2ad although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
2234865f706759eb5217c759c1c4ca1e this is a great camera for you !
3ecea01aa95a76d9bd9b4d7dc527100d the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
dfd88ca0008f555cb2ee50c9bc7364bd i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
c97426f7e6b7627ae5bb73ee0fe03b0b i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
a132db45183ba2fa489bbbb91d064371 but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
be379679dac602b9b58a047cfe52bfb9 with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
075cbfa6d23b531fc7100bc9ad7dcd00 the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
333e87ce30ba03bd6f411b6b04304e07 this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
00d2f82e48aec8fa7159c18aacd4231e you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
e3163cfbf1a2a8658ef2e18c239ed215 the more i work with it , the more i love it !
9179b4447526ca5c32b2739ed1b73425 i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
03ba56f0d39bdcc405e0e8c231587f54 this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
8b7a2a16ebe59c4c1e768219e7c70666 seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
449b83653dd0d66d7d910483ebd3238b but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
acc07df0d0a7226dc75dea8bb027282e four megapixels is great .
422a11e639c07092b1c6f1061216613a it is a very amazing product .
2d3e289bff7e49c5d65a2b9a371afaa7 i highly recommend it .
60d51173b03f01faf9dbc703ee9747d8 just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
7ced1ec672304d6828f66711815f1d0e takes excellent photos .
e3ea45cafb8b9b6384468f74d67066a9 night mode is clear as day .
7b864546c446967ac419696b3efe756b i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
3f56f9123b8ffd9edf96d25020e6c445 the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
cb31f35d3c35ce640d8c859b871da89a overall it is the best camera on the market .
a3966ba04d7e675a36911883e1bc65b2 a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
c4daa0a8d538737f8537bac4506b577c b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
59b9fcd4b43fac3e776c958a98b3b229 the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
4451b508ffcdcf474c6d4776729d055c i love this camera .
16cd32323d48271d45afd13c1449f1f2 took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
e4ef0ebc749295bdb2fcb874531a583e great colors , pictures and white balance .
9c511d7377199e39382403fcb7e09331 has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
d211a3661ae067c32807a4c7f4150211 maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
9e8470bd77da18223d6468cfecabbc3d it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
0295dca0a3cc0a1a8b9bf4cbd0109e3c sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
031b904a61e903f18f947e9c55fd4cfa i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
491e7ad37f09de99ba745957bd2388c7 the grain was terrible .
45a25aa300594454ca7bc12595df25f5 well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
4af1a9d196ac9035aeb134474256ef16 when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
7a86d5e0935a31a320bf4effa3643576 the camera was a marvel .
c75e76ae4ae18bd6f1757752f4fa4423 it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
5f746eb360f99eec03f4c5b8efb8f138 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
7ce68523e9bd23cb9fa8f5c8bfadfa9f the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
f1824e287ef5aafaf050e6870ece87c3 what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
d189707ad42028eec72db14fec45c699 relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
4a93d8f10f505f7246805579982dd792 fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
865f5ce19fc754d56e712de777b1bcae contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
20c5a2780290c04a8fff006233aee834 now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
c9e60af8c804cc7bc30a164554f7375d the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
d94ba22ec1c68f129a09d111449a5e89 what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
38c47be19193cb76675feafd049a684c without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
511a23f3a4fe98af1bf9d231291e4dff the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
d00579c5aee168118aee6243ff803b1c what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
ca42696d0e457f98f2255b29dfa3f6dc but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
8cff8b3bb4b722f290108da2b2fcc548 i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
ae682834131538abcaa95e46cca3ad98 i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
f4d33ef7024c0c93baef74d60978635e this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
68f771352d0e49722a16c9efbc7c8342 battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
1e4f51a49d87c73315e133f37c3a3ce3 manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
4ee6d1359bfe9bbb24c18ef20aa068d0 not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
d7f31e78e351ca72ab37f3787d581e2b the service from the supplier was exceptional .
e02a562b016c98f5f4937af42dd41dba having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
3797f31b7e658ca2289e807be4ce0066 by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
1f8107d369d0a9aff676c54f789d4256 the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
0c497fa3be9389b212b112840b0bb06e about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
d5ff58c43fef03e404437a12b2520326 i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
a2ab8a9ad0aa0c299ae01e2d3beafe89 but canon never fails to amaze .
09dcc4017d14685e8ff06df572330fe5 1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
d52f5e6f17b27cadd223d0665cf39034 2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
f33e57d6d1b0be40187d83879a82c9ea 3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
b39d64cf16678723054310d16f83cb20 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
8182a54db1c1a13a5564eec84cb70c34 the light auto-correction is awesome .
bbd842f2292be37cfe4f30cf8c94dd30 you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
6d83bfcc23edb75f2b0631cc2223e8ba 8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
f774d50a8c6d2e482b4e764362bf0ccb overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
f1d9c861c8f3012ffd57a678756df65d this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
ca1eaed91c3e55f4cceab5acd302386c the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
80ccab7499b52c8d7a9bb1f85ab5e9d6 got way too many blurry pictures .
ea03c1eca4f4843d18fa28fa8e577b5c 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
d0b638f07549767cb3b25c3f2d07ce93 the powershot g3 is a great camera .
df9d18fa4b2ff7598d3524494f2cffb9 because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
23e69255ff5527dfe5e34c9e371f9fde 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
a820ec8ce849643a61378f3b7b7ef1ec it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
65037ef283c79017feb83dc35b38876e the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
1841e550884b5dc5aca425c2c970ac62 it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
8b8f2cd83fd31792df2d49dda223d1d0 canon 's g3 does it consistently .
d1ae657ded216525d98c55cabe90361b it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
b82837c0f2aa0002e428df001cedfcd8 unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
48bcb8b7a73b431d17faa7c86416eb2c this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
e6ee9cb3ab7027d3beb58513892b3c95 i love the quality of the pictures .
1d0ab27b49ca58295a61d878a73a4522 they look fantastic .
ee59320ea439564bfb6e244ed61ae28d the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
af189e49f9bda21796bc6e5b42d476bb with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
c987fcf46ffc653deb0043f19e9b0e71 i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
7bdbd4c1cd8be1242a1117464c413af3 1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
9f347041683eb18b50734c57bed47aaa 2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
299b1b3b82ed7f53d93796dd70e2715e it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
f031c2ba348ffc7846fa61dc61016955 i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
4e7c923125c6ecab9de7b6e8ee712cf3 this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
3f629d42477151daeb491614951012a0 another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
b36e0aa3746cf7609c08e3323c9c46d4 am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
865ea00ba670fc3054260a8b5b0d9e2b i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
5deb915c0f8e40d34ff37101c900e021 very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
51897af1e6e933645f228aa21c7f28d4 the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
061d8f8a6d7c08ee50f8cc4d4e1b0344 the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
dbec951619c24117174bfb3323091148 one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
6fe1a6cfcc61bb420320d4d66e4e64c4 the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
fce426bd640deac130f446f53b1b80af because this camera is beautiful .
f25f01faaec7c0eb164eab2e8c6d364e the g3 looks like a work of art !
c12f2cbdc52ec5949ef5f7247c336b99 its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
1c9cc87ce15ace0c262a7b27d36ba45e i am very pleased with it so far .
b974783e13b69f38d3a2b7aa1ac5eef1 you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
6ffc2fca6b80ce48f3f157af9606f9d4 ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
51691753f1446ed784e1e75e2da94ffb it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
381cbba6fbf05b57f5065fbd5a751974 it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
62231128d8faa8397072e0f77601ae9a i am quite happy with the camera .
153d740584b0562e7e6b29315153d94c it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
926605e0deb817f30e467743d8edd92d yes , i recommend it over the competition .
86b3450ce22023f2c9edfbb1431b515e best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
da46710dc8d7f047b7d2852a70779dbb this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
bf6a7e1803fcb60ab4e76c2f4119489b first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
71587775ee12268cfb110affaaf5b612 this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
1bf2d650dc6dd01868ac513222995eda however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
28625e5528127fc1474b0e6dad55a8cb it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
3aa385cd2dfa03cfff8df46bd9cee92d also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
921a0e8cd129e569ee56a67d7ae96da1 one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
1bea3ea293d255cd27ba76a46ede23ef another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
5ac53d99601e0ac19ef6cc71435053f3 i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
315c1b71c3150d8e7f65cc42175f4817 it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
b77323e5d1559f20cb309eca1ea9653a in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
10a83c7e21b9720dc95f09ab9dd06707 it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
e2aef133b34cdd27cfe0ae786a800c64 the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
caf29bf9e5b2a8eb2fc8b6c6eac3992b in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
93660e27380a8f799061833519133c50 the included memory card is too small .
f2981378db18ffecc4c71766b545b0ed it is made of plastic .
ef9668457ba8f4611b4fb06633bff330 the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
43a10b217a6096218dd793443cb53e1b while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
263d74deb404b19e3971f7520d49ff06 the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
f11b6493f562e48e09dd1f455dcac0d3 flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
be780476104bcc4ce67b3dd09ac7ffbc the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
573ec1f4c104f557d3ef4a81d7b846a1 the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
7f1c1b92e8f206c138f4db63d898414e canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
1fce91bb44da1197a328766d1f0f3781 learning how to use it will not take very long .
115727d751fe0038fc2b16ac5e044115 the image quality is excellent .
b43eea60a6e26ef2d546c1544c0e533f range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
5d3199c4c10ac5b497205480f52f828d this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
4ee8d0b641c875e17446b74fd975c596 the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
e4e579de7f6a6a60872e54f2bea20df1 this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
3ec7686efff20053a4b1216ba6846586 i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
6a027761fd1a773fda5290ddec3beaef yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
17ea77f8baef8743561f50cf960f3ff5 in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
6d9c0c4ae3a7b3f059e38dc675228984 the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
81d3dd1e17d14ddd0b1999bbf02cad36 i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
e446b8cb57e505d5021f433bc13a8ed1 the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
5b3c35f2d0200b492eb1d84caff2bd26 it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
48c9089c4729e58f320f3da81288ee13 to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
67b82e06f82e9130f9d542e0ab393f06 this camera has a major design flaw .
147a916c1effce3110d2582e4b8b49a5 when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
c011703935a9bcb4fe2a8bf0e1e00a40 everything else about the camera is great .
2acf539000dfb941b35ec78656c5b1b5 if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
0c48e1b20c7afece2144d42e34a1a15f and so far , i 've been very pleased .
a7d8e305d570d95f2e66cc869353dc9a the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
3bce35cc8493a2cd4c47a2a358643b7c the moveable lcd screen is great .
a4bf04bb2ffffdf15f1e93ccd942ba31 the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
93044d769d91e4c087a96f9c378ce5c6 the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
7168bc93960c3ccae9ad72cc71ab956b i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
7a6127bd06125c9102ab880f8919a4d0 the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
41d67c7360f1eaff9b82be88ea00f3d7 i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
84224827af1c6fbe4ff62db111e2e0b4 i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
dfb1e702c3280b5fd148ea2e3efce750 the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
5a88ccedfd94e24afcf32afe34d0dad6 and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
c24124e72afb21806504f88eb5809b93 i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
34400085cb3b7c1e079b9e19bd044b91 i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
5d8b5507ce45f152c58e301e745b132e very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
682f66e2e701df8ae5c2394498111504 i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
ab5381ff92d93f31f37a3da98c2c14a6 all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
ebe4e490a3d80b57d701bfa3b8e96ec7 canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
dd71767481d19a9a0e0a0368b626b97e simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
17ecb94e8bd613415517e78ec1f1c520 the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
e30184599d5c95a24e9a14a132efb341 the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
861626d0cc4cc5ae19684d4b8d53194c even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
c014bc886849ad4649bc5b4f66967a90 definetely a great camera .
1a2ff0b2fd0f3902bbc4db99f334bf30 proven canon built quality and lens .
4073922627870a25467c904c1f869dfc feels solid in hand .
2d02822aaf070b5602c867e2c6872e5d rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
