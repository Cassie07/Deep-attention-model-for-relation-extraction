8de65221e06c8847ca5178ea15e60bb3 this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
ab7ca5cbb8b25a52411977cdb137ac97 the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
2db31a231937141d8dcd068acfc3f1ce it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
c693a7e2bbe7daf29d73e854e6535042 it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
f4ed4ae3305445dd6ec6f73ce7ad7b7c operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
ad7d797df83b5741108707e4fcd267a0 the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
9faf0a7bfc43d9a419ce8a897488d3e6 the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
28ce5a5d99f26c9f2dbe0be5134a0068 comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
56b6edc98c5db1d4c4d71a78b24a32e3 i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
611cd84ef2797167021575937265cb17 it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
3e862711b9c6b61022e139ccc3d36f8a in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
35636dc6c8ce4141590da7ebbaa88850 the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
85867662c99ae16df91919b54a6588a7 the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
4f404b3948413c53cce61743a7146b81 the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
ab55f8223c7f8eb0cdf00f7b75379e04 i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
9c725122d3b7c7c0a0c6becf2b40e44c this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
0ebcdfef8bb972e3ec21c12e403b87b6 with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
5c59913a2746f9f7b8bdc5d1d2d9d4b0 1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
6ad0a727a8cbd3903423023f8fd39dac . this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
d344448a7a486c45523610328a8804ee . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
ba08f88960a15c13eeee899c951d2890 . images taken indoor were n't so clear .
43bfbc97e6e8d92dd0db0d2c9496e92f . lens cap is a really annoying
d26b6ce9e6ae6bf633a32f98ba2130ac . the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
7c796cc382127a60c5fb968230a6441f but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
fe0cd81774e23f37e184cc373b601419 within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
04644ae09ccdab517139e51d9b12fb84 i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
858a58b51860cbf88e1296d8838558d1 it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
1ade23040368ba3c81f637504edbafc3 got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
d8aec8197d90051b1905ab04d212a10b made the camera totally inoperable .
c40d27579cdd927868e3e9866251f9b0 also , the lens cap design is flawed .
25cbfa15d29773c91313a905515b2078 audio on video also lacking .
695d490cea19970e52fa3608c2ac96c8 otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
d0daccfd58ec29fbb2753db534018ca5 nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
f54837594a492a2e5cd420e057d57eb4 the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
99ff835b6afc80eb98a8e6d0778a550c 1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
9a0c2c401f7f0515a8b07827ed8550ab 2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
5c1f1d66d58cb4a5efe5515cfd7babe3 3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
25f1f8f4fcf4347f670a82ba0dcf9ac1 the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
20dbab3ec3be9a7c52eb8932beb60154 the movie mode is also working great .
3649de2567f56d923eed19f3229fac58 the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
9f043f0ebf4759c2f9e477ec5b0d50d5 i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
fc9c733c80eb0e7cc04d22457ba2ed86 even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
44873790ea23216766d90c328539e664 the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
113723c117c44d3f1da9fb6a41a2ac71 over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
c2510219e55b231a7fcea212a897c722 focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
bc5b775fbaf3738d15534b70ed290f17 after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
6c8553c3c50ea94e8903ac7ad2b1d889 the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
4c6c28d1390c22b69d834cde174cecbc the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
60439c997db437e7d90d94b08c0f8e09 i love all of the features , and presets as well .
6d684c866ef5f2cfdc9402370457791d sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
8014d78afa6f3ec55703089524168aea the software you get with this camera is perfect .
50c321595603f8a73b80de24c33a2d9a touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
11c073db11d440a6405218767fcb1e30 battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
94ede871dd61d7308d1e56b41b9b6165 all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
a037bc2334cf7856abb5cb99ee6cd3d8 great camera , great investment !
1da9da21f6c3e925964f446dfeae9895 the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
ea53c53fc9e2227743582fff6448ffe9 the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
be4e9a19d2b204275ec3196e89ef4502 it has many great features and very few bad ones .
0d9c98a0b96f462fb9a75d73a026a16e it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
b0922801b5dea8dd234139e96c8e2937 the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
8e15abfa6bd176e922dff2e1b273e3d8 downloads are a snap and quick .
385f6554344ce3fdba684ad8bf694cd7 controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
e86feb747296e1fd2b900f47b7977e62 i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
e1059b8f0b964b9d4a7371a1719ac5a7 really happy with this little camera .
d2a913edc5214212a1cedcb2d85b407e it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
0d8185b14013eb0f62080f7c2c1f1129 settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
fc74409b72829e8f76ff6ce7e7d9c3eb i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
af71635b2c094a32f231726f4484cd17 still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
fa9bea2213c882ed1c6758c2c27a2af5 this is a wonderful camera .
f11f55733c97916bcac103090871b473 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
6ae2424de3771ebb00464135ccc4aa6f one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
9f0a61055e1f449cb62f85d3d95c52bd this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
f911630310801ab1119c6a52bf2fa0da the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
e9cea108831bf3b5f22307c5802bfb9e just point and shoot and the photos were great .
b4b5a23cada0b0ad1cb6c1b712144ea4 the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
b90042c61dd22f271426a9114ceb5795 if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
ef8b221188025f77306dd1fd16320e12 great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
ac4ab040f5068449f5d661c742ded24a this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
a3b0eea6fef24303e358dc36a867f602 it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
1d21e72801ffebefdc107e08b9c2a77c i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
9008ef909da63f512db033a5802b1c96 my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
cf51f45d15ab0de7653c9471be6744a8 one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
5a6fa5ac2e10fb276c272967872cd6ea battery life is ok .
49fddc188547ceed107c560e4e129e1f great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
7535f2ba14887c38e6ac8f7506ffcfe4 i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
af7d35dfb477b1380d658f4b0e01cb93 the quality is superb .
ce241be0dc19c920cb8070b418b49068 the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
11d4adf2e9b14f04ddf39931fb54ce88 the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
c258388ac50d5b84b13964b0049cfc7c it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
e1bd5ad35029a8f26c1e0a0c638d55cf it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
8f1edc64c84015b10807f4939eeba8f1 it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
c04938f6d553c4e369ea501705c0aff3 it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
97224a9d11f9869b7bb37913f20d0e1d they take excellent macro shots as well .
edb3b3c6a9612649298f6346ee785f39 the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
e57e4cc3bf2f9080a633de533530e261 i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
af84fa31887ee8e6bec010e54f41b54b the picturers are amazing .
164dda298348d815567dec7d16e56e32 recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
31f52e099867e5131f5cabd5abfd9c04 i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
22acb9431eff5025a15adbaf9c736917 the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
9e23440344513995e9ef9d800416e9c8 a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
4283cf0438864dd7aa4566ca679cc53b i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
aa73993d4557884c74f06f0eedfa8251 we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
d8ae4e38ba46e2a5b51819e114d5c4bf i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
3b23a6676433e5d337c07af06b5eb348 i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
42f0ce4c366e69f992de1c95467b18e7 the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
e0cd2d947bd8cc450958f358f558c226 uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
747107cdbe2f2c1bbb64da5fa3d529a4 the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
44f5c6a5f212781662da69ddc16ece4d 2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
379dfca54f93189bf1ffa8a9ccae065d 3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
d70accb3661a2674ab2766a0dd695dae in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
c0cd1658c30cb16d99fbca9f888c59f5 great camera .
e98ecaf7d8bf1bd365d78286f5ada68a i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
736ae5070578444c8cf7f228710c97da it takes great pictures .
ff2a33cedae986d4f1514b696e39034b the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
458d078bcbf409501f17556c352faf85 it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
c1a2a8c959c589c71818b293fabc625c i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
e0a2186c7537ef86190504d475e55254 i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
6ab5e8c4fc8cb5905e79f4c8ff6d9ff5 autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
9051667b552ab64e5d03897e26b0a4bd i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
c8106167362bd7e1044da7b373bd21af picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
d4954af171cda06cc040755bc979e934 on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
0d8e8b4e2ac064b6d95ba6b1626e37d3 i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
17387e4c8cd3f0c2f86dc084b6a86c18 the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
906a24afd94faa28c90ee066ad67ebb9 however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
2d3d3d47aa5812c5767bcd8d62c2bc24 if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
e71bfa23d0bac20249b5f7a3754b3ca7 after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
d03f98646be6254d949650bd4e9d9ba9 after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
7e902b1c3bac0da57adc7cb4cce23d18 its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
b13c80fc598343871332702ba79bf0a7 yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
cc90bbee0ce57ccc7e1b784c1f46fd96 the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
9a500297c21bf39ce8d23a80a2266c9f there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
fd51673347884f77113ef2e226796d23 seriously ! i love it !
a5d898eb672a4f4889c7cc06168cb6da but this camera is great !
c7a84f3bce8b390d7c504dda126b0043 the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
725441f37b752c1ded51fc3639839472 it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
69cd91eb12dfeb95ccbf465a278b5453 the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
f8fa77a39d46ecc23ee6c2f2659dd3e5 ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
1769a914d0cd227d1f05d83abc44b3d3 it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
d27aa3bf91dd03907b232f24ef4eeb12 it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
5881e9601bc8ceb222a7a2d40997a8ab i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
2f83fe76d6c65089aa8744a484b1d5d3 i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
03d5c557350aa022c2973a9c5ded18da i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
cc9dccf941a21ed9c992e937dd87e6d7 8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
2abada426eb39ff34e5f9db63fa51f6e 1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
50cf7592ad1ba3cc17dab3102c2caa84 2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
39e5ba4fdeb5f16fb0a7683a6195790c 3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
e57e99b63f36faa469386ebe96c8a577 6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
a245cc8c0d049db1f832f29a7c5409f3 7 picture quality is excellent .
d02c6998726f30044f440d4b317a7650 8 battery life is excellent .
e491de776f6467fdb1663c6c350255cb 9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
5408e4563e95c36874dcaf6a786a5d7c 10 great price for all the features .
ce464cd88cb342df31ecbc4199065390 1 no direct firewire to the camera .
8ea89a382ec48b0e0d5b6dadc5ced358 2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
a3c39ca74e64f9139dabb40cc958b72d this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
13dec75bed7e631821be24ba46df1b44 the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
d06f8f2da7d367fc21c6523bb8a6ed32 it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
e389400b358904930d1a6caf7c8dd8e6 overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
0bf10edcdbe26b58e9aa01bf73526b56 awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
d2ecbc0b6c5a83518582c7e8d313b9b7 the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
0a97bbb3a0da722d9e48e3c05e77a24c in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
